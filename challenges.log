            "When doing the testing, I noticed that if I start spamming the &quot;Player 1&quot; and &quot;Player 2&quot; buttons while another player is currently playing, at one point the game entered some kind of error state and the Players sprites got duplicated. The duplicated ones stayed on the cell of the turn that gave the error. To solve this easily I would keep a state variable that indicates if a player is currently playing and if so I would disable not only my button but the other players button. As a sanity check, I would keep track of the number of Player sprites (1 and 2) and if the number is larger than 1, I would remove the invalid ones from the game.            In the future, it would be good if the author implemented multiple levels or, to keep things fresh, make the levels procedurally generated to allow infinite replayability.            Just having the option to roll a dice and move the player is kind of boring. It would be fun if (like for example in monopoly) the user gained some kind of power up when stepping on specific tiles. These power ups can be either to give a personal advantage (like move an extra +3 tiles) or to hurt the adversary&#039;s chances (like &quot;the opponent moves back 3 tiles).            Overall, the game shows a lot of potential for improvement and might be a fresh take on the genre, depending on the choices the author makes going forward.",
            "The game is well-made and easy to play, as its difficulty and controls are well-balanced.      However, I found it only partially fun. While it&#039;s easy to get into, it&#039;s purely based on luck, with no need for strategy or meaningful player choices.      To improve it, I would suggest adding a special effect when a player lands on certain spaces.",

However, the large amount of empty white space makes the interface feel unbalanced and unfinished. Consider centering the board or adding a background frame or grid to make the play area feel more visually cohesive. Also, the UI text at the top could benefit from consistent alignment and a more polished font style to improve overall presentation and readability.

Consider adding subtle textures, gradients, or thematic colours or fonts to make the interface feel more polished and lively.       To make it feel more like a game, maybe consider adding a landing screen with &quot;start game&quot; button and an option to exit the game.            The code is generally clear and well-structured, with good use of comments that make it easy to follow. There are a few areas that could be improved for maintainability and performance:      - the check_win() function repeats sum calculations on every loop iteration and could be optimized by separating row, column, and diagonal checks into cleaner helper functions      - using constants for magic numbers like 4 (board size) and 16 (max moves) would make the code more scalable and easier to adjust later      - simple error checks (e.g. ensuring circle_scene and square_scene are not null) would improve robustness",

Input handling is solid, prioritizing piece selection correctly, but the _unhandled_input method is doing too much work and would benefit from refactoring for readability. Overall the UI is sleek, accessible and clear - very enjoyable to play.

            "The game is the classic &quot;4 in a row&quot;. As improvements, I would point out:            Missing game audio. To keep the players engaged, I would of liked to hear some kind of ambient music and sound effects (for example when clicking the buttons or when placing the balls on the game board).            To keep gameplay fresh, I would have liked if the author implemented some kind of AI that can play in the place of a human.            Instead of just 4 in a row, it would be interesting if the game allowed for custom board dimensions, for example 5x5, 6x6, 10x10 etc. After reviewing the code, I saw that the author used a GridContainer and placed buttons to act as the cells. It would have been simpler if the author used a tilemap, that way he could create custom game boards much more easily programatically and would keep the implementation and scenes &quot;tidier&quot;.            Since the author added a main menu, it would be interesting to see a pause menu when the user presses the Esc key so that he can restart the level or go back to the menu.            In terms of good points:            It is good to see that the author added a scene where he explains how the game works instead of assuming people would instantly know how to play.            The background, buttons and text fonts look good together, adding a good feel for the look of the game.",
