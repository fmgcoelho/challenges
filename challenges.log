            "I think the game is well done overall, but i also think that it would be great if the ui was more polished, so it would be easier to spot the elements of the games especially the type of tiles. A lot of the times is really hard to see intantly what tile would fit in each position",
            "I struggled to understand how to actually play the game in the beginning. The &quot;how-to-play&quot; section consisted of a lot of text which I didn&#039;t quite understand due to the language barrier.      The controls were a little unintuitive for me with both mouse and keyboard.      After I understood the concept though, it was quite fun to play and the UI design was nice.",
            "The game design is clever and cohesive, blending exploration, strategy, and tension in a simple yet engaging loop. The shrinking desert and fog of war mechanics effectively reinforce the feeling of urgency, while the tile-placement system keeps every decision meaningful. The balance between luck and planning feels well thought out. However, pacing might benefit from a bit more variation — for example, adding minor events or environmental twists to keep longer sessions dynamic. Overall, it’s an elegant and original design that stands out for its clarity and strong thematic consistency.",
        ],
        "formal-feedback": [
            "Everything was well implemented, i personally would llove to see a bit of code snippets showing every part of the formal description in practice",
            "The formal description is strong and directly usable for development. It shows good understanding of game logic and data flow. To improve, expand slightly on edge cases and visual state transitions.",
            "The formal description is precise, logically organized, and demonstrates a solid understanding of game state modeling. The use of mathematical notation and clear variable definitions shows rigor and clarity. However, while the structure is strong, some elements could benefit from more explicit detail — for instance, how the storm or FOV updates are handled in transitions. Additionally, the document would be improved by maintaining consistency in notation and ensuring all symbols (like variables and functions) are clearly defined. Overall, it’s a well-constructed formalization that reflects careful thought, but a bit more depth and uniformity would make it even clearer.",

            "There is nothing to be said here, no extra features were implemented",
            "Hard mode not present as a separate mode. However, difficulty can be tuned indirectly by adjusting storm frequency, FOV radius, or tile type probabilities. Could be formalized later as a “Hard Mode” preset.      Against the Clock Mode - also not explicitly included. The existing storm mechanic already acts as a soft time pressure - this could easily evolve into a formal timed/challenge mode.",
            "The game’s single difficulty level works well for maintaining a consistent, balanced experience, but the absence of adjustable difficulty (no easy or hard mode) may limit its appeal to different player types. Introducing optional difficulty settings — for example, changing storm speed, FOV radius, or tile distribution — could let players tailor the challenge to their preference. This would improve accessibility for beginners while offering greater tension for experienced players. Overall, the design is strong, but adding scalable difficulty would increase replayability and player satisfaction.",

            "Nothing to be said here, everything was well implemented in my opinion",

            "The concept document is thorough, well-structured, and demonstrates a clear understanding of both gameplay and design principles. The mechanics, goals, and balance are all explained with great precision and depth. However, the document is written in Portuguese, when it should be in English — this limits accessibility and makes it harder for non-Portuguese readers to evaluate or collaborate. Translating it into clear, concise English would make the work look more professional and align it with common industry standards. Overall, it’s an excellent concept that just needs proper localization to reach its full potential.",
        ],
        "challenge-feedback": [
            "I think the most of the aspects were well done, but i believe that the getting out of space mechanic should be more noticeble, i know it exists but, while playing i did not feel it&#039;s effects.",
            "Looks good to me - format is correct and there was a concept document included.      The UI design is alien-themed and the game works without issues.      I couldn&#039;t get the game to work with more than 1 player.",
            "The game’s challenge is well aligned with its theme — the shrinking desert and limited visibility create constant tension and urgency, pushing players to think strategically with every move. The balance between luck (tile draw) and skill (placement and movement) keeps gameplay engaging and fair. However, the storm frequency and FOV range may need fine-tuning to ensure the difficulty curve feels progressive rather than punishing. Introducing small adaptive elements, like variable storm pacing or tile distribution, could help maintain tension without frustration. Overall, it’s a well-crafted and thematic challenge that keeps players on edge in a fun way.",

The most critical one occurs at the start of a gameplay session. The main character spawns too close to the monsters&#039; spawn point, which causes the player to die immediately upon starting.

However, adding a few more interactive elements or tile types could make matches feel more dynamic over time.

Its like do you drink in small sips when you are thirsty or do you drink continuously until the glass is empty?. I just find it a bit idiotic to have to move back and forward three times to pick up all the energy. Nevertheless... the game is winnable.",

As noted in the checklist, all design aspects are well-executed: the goals are clear, the controls are intuitive, and the assets create a strong, cohesive theme. The core mechanics are engaging and motivate the player to keep trying.      The game is deceptively challenging. While the rules are simple, successfully collecting all five &quot;buried artifacts&quot; and reaching the end is not an easy task.      This difficulty is a major strength, not a weakness. It is perfectly balanced; it feels tough but fair, which makes the game much more interesting and adds significant replayability. The &quot;bad point&quot; is actually the best part of the design. My suggestion is to maintain this exact balance, as it hits a perfect spot that makes the player want to come back for one more try.",
            "Just walking over the hidden objects doesn&#039;t provide a visual feedback (other than the screen blinking, but that could be and involuntary movement accompanied by a sucessful action) it should be an action event where the player has to dig (with some downside like wasting energy) in order to make sure that the player has doing the action consciously, because right now it fills like look at compass and let it happen.      Of course this is just a minor complain, it would just add to the game immersion and make it more coerce with real life events.",

Bad:      The game would benefit with more meaningful choices like power-ups and an inventory system that would allow players to only use items as needed.            The game could include enemies hidden in the sands that would pop-up when a player stepped on them.

Bad:      The game lacks a soundtrack or sound effects, it would help with the overall feel and ambient of the game.      The game does not have a Running Out of Space mechanic in the sense that the playable area is being reduced, the &quot;Running Out of Space&quot; stems from the overall energy reduction per each movement of the Alien. The energy term could be replaced by life and the game could have hidden enemies that were revealed when the alien steps on their tile. These would in turn reduce the life of the player, requiring visits to the oasis or specific power ups.            Regarding the power-ups, the author could have implemented some powerups like health packs and shields (if the game had enemies), these could be stored in an inventory to add meaningful choices and a strategic layer to the game.            For the running out of space mechanic, the game could implement something like a sandstorm that would swallow the map, in turn this sandstorm could start reducing the players life continuously if they come in contact with it.",

But the game should really have instructions, one time i played, the game had a score of 3/3 and 2 corrupted, and the game didn&#039;t say anything, i just kept on playing and had to close it to start a new game.

It would help if the author added better sprites instead of colored cards and hopes that the player instinctively knows what they mean.      - The player sends a history of player actions and movements to the standard output of the Godot editor, but the author has to remember that when the game is released, the players will not have access to the STD_OUT to see console messages, therefore it would be good practice to send those messages to a richTextBox with vertical scrollbars so that the players and have a written history of what has transpired in past turns.",
            "Well, the game&#039;s building condition is okay. But not playable. Placing tiles and nothing else to do. Does not attract the player to invest time while playing. Simply not playable. Some colored tiles are there, and the player moves around them. For the goal and to play the game, it is kinda hard to say - else the building logic is fine, the game maintains that.",

The distinction of the difficulty levels only affects the probability of the tile containing the necessary parts to fix the ship. It would be interesting to include other variables, like player life (that would be decreased if the player hits a creature nest) or reduction of the number of turns before the storm begins. By not including damage by stomping on a creature nest, those tiles serve no purpose other than decorative and have the same function as the regular desert tiles.",

            "I did not find the game fun to play because the lack of in-game sprites to clearly convey what each tile represent meant I was very confused during play and therefore was not enjoying myself.             The game state is hard to understand, that is mostly because of a lack of audio or visual feedback when for example the user exausts the available tile placements for the current turn. I ended confused and trying all buttons to see if the turn advances. This was mostly because the game state was being sent to the console, and since it was not on the game view, it ended up not achieving it&#039;s goal of informing the player of the game.            The assets are just simple colored cards, they could include images of a lake and palm trees for the oasis tile, wavy lines for the desert tile, and an animal sprite for a creature nest (like snake, scorpion, lizard, etc).            There does not seem to be any meaningfull choices since the only player action is drawing a tile and placing it on the map. Does not matter where on the map it is placed, since it does not change the type of the tile or it&#039;s effects.",
            "Design is a circle and some blocks. -Pretty simple. In these types of games, we need a way to understand the game from the get-go, and because of those interactions and graphical cues being missing, it makes the gameplay boring.",

            "The author has successfully defined the game&#039;s logic using formal notation. It correctly identifies and breaks down the core Game State (S), the possible Player Actions (move, boosting_light), and the explicit Victory/Defeat Conditions. This level of detail is excellent for a technical implementation, as it leaves no ambiguity for a programmer.      While this mathematical model is very complete and technically accurate, it is not easily readable for team members in non-programming roles (like artists, producers, or other designers). It describes what the system is, but not how it&#039;s intended to be experienced.      It is suggested to keep this excellent technical breakdown, but to add a short, plain-English summary (a prose description) at the beginning of this section. This summary would explain the same concepts—what the player does, what their goals are, and how they win or lose—in simple, descriptive language. This would make the document much more accessible to the entire team.",

Bad:            I would like to see the inclusion of a more detailed explanation of these rules influence the game. For example, in the game state section, it would be beneficial to map the Godot variables that handle the game state to the mathematical counterparts and offer a small explanation of how these act together in the progression of play.      In the game views, I feel that the inclusion of print screens of the game detailing each element would offer the reviewer a much better context than just the pure mathematical sense. A diagram detailing the navigation between each view would also be good to be included, establishing relations between scenes.",

            "The project shows significant promise and provides an enjoyable experience. The game is highly intuitive from the start, and its visual presentation is a clear strength, featuring clean graphics and a polished, nice aesthetic. The story is also engaging, effectively motivating player exploration.      A central point of feedback relates to the difficulty of locating the exit. It was challenging to a degree that it became unclear if this difficulty was an intentional part of the core design (meant to force deep exploration) or if the player was missing necessary cues.      Should this high level of challenge be intentional, it is suggested that the author consider implementing subtle environmental signposting. This would not make the game &quot;too easy&quot; or spoil the puzzle, but it would help guide the player&#039;s attention, ensuring the discovery feels rewarding rather than a source of frustration. It is a solid and enjoyable build overall.",

            "Good:            I liked the game! The inclusion of an ambient sound adds to the despairing atmosphere of the game when traversing unknown terrain.      I like the mechanic where the map slowly fills with sand, trapping the player.      The fog of war mechanic also helps with the mystery aspect of the game.            Bad:            Not so much a bad thing, but it would be fun if the author included some kind of power-ups to help with player progression, like power packs that give players an energy boost to survive longer or some kind of mechanic that can freeze the sands progression, buying time to explore more to find the exit.            Although the game features tiles, I&#039;m not sure if it qualifies as being similar to carcassone or settlers of catan because those games are turn based, while this one is real time.",

The foundation for a 4-player multiplayer mode is also a fantastic and ambitious addition, which opens up a completely different, social way to play the game.      The features that are present are great. The only &quot;bad point&quot; is that I was left wanting more of them, as this area has a lot of potential.      To build on this strong foundation, the author could consider expanding the accessibility options. Simple additions like key remapping or controller support would be very welcome.

The aesthetic design is a high point; the player character and the world environment are not only visually appealing but also work perfectly together to support the game&#039;s central theme and create a compelling atmosphere.      To elevate the design further, perhaps consider introducing one or two small mechanical variations or new interactions as the player progresses. This could add an extra layer of depth to the experience, rewarding the player&#039;s engagement without complicating the successful intuitive feel.",

Otherwise, everything is perfect and sound.",

The inclusion of a HUD makes the game state easy to understand, conveying health and energy levels and also remaining time until game ends.      WASD controls are easy to use.            Bad:      The only meaningful choices the player can do are select the path they go on or to activate a &quot;light&quot; that gives extra view of the fog of war. It would be interesting to include power-ups that could be placed in an inventory and called whenever the player needs them, adding a layer of strategy and resource management.",

            "The game looks wonderful. It looks elegant in design. Design and creativity-wise, the game is fine. But the theme of running out of space was not implemented in the game. The tiles are similar, but the use of the tiles is not used as intended.",
            "Great game! It&#039;s very fun, complete, and meets all the requirements. I found no bugs, and it&#039;s fully functional. The one thing I&#039;d improve is the turn indicator in the UI. Since the inventory only updates after a player spins the wheel, it can be confusing to figure out whose turn it is.",

Additionally, incorporating mathematical formulas in each section could help evaluate the implementation with greater objectivity.      Other than that, this is outstanding work. Well done!",

It&#039;s fun, the assets match the theme perfectly, the controls are easy to use, and the difficulty levels are well balanced. The only aspect I would improve relates to meaningful choices, as I believe the game relies more on luck than strategy. Players are forced to move the exact number of spaces shown on the spinner, and the items only serve to restore health. To enhance this, I would suggest changing the function of some items, especially since three of them have very similar effects and don’t require any strategic thinking. For example, one item could allow players to advance extra spaces, forcing them to decide whether to take a risk and move further or stick with their current turn.",

            "This project has a strong visual start, but the core game design is currently incomplete.      Good Points: The assets are high-quality and match the theme, creating a pleasant visual atmosphere. The basic game controls are also functional and intuitive.      Points for Consideration (Bad Points): The fundamental design loop is missing. As noted in the checklist, the game is not currently fun or engaging because there are no clear player goals, no motivating mechanics, and no meaningful choices. The player can move, but this movement has no cost, consequence, or purpose. This also means there is no difficulty, which is a key part of any game.      Suggestion for Improvement: The absolute priority must be to define and implement the core gameplay loop.      First, define a clear goal (e.g., &quot;Collect 5 items,&quot; &quot;Reach the exit&quot;).      Second, introduce the central conflict/mechanic (this is where the &quot;Running out of space&quot; theme should apply, such as an energy cost for moving, a timer, or shrinking space).      Without a goal and a challenge, it&#039;s not yet a game, but the visual foundation is ready for one.",

This is a natural consequence of the core game design being incomplete. Before &quot;optional&quot; modes can be added, the base game loop must be implemented first.

            "This project has a pleasant visual foundation, but it currently feels more like a tech demo than a complete game, as it is missing several core challenge requirements.      Good Points: The game is aesthetically pleasing. The assets are nice, the layout is clean, and the visual presentation is good.      Points for Consideration (Bad Points): The main issue is a significant lack of clarity and missing features.      No Introduction: The game loads directly onto the board without a main menu, instructions, or context.      No Player Selection: It automatically forces 4 players onto the board, which is confusing and does not fulfill the &quot;one to four players&quot; requirement (as there is no choice).      Missing Objective: There is no clear goal. Players can move across the tiles indefinitely, but nothing happens. There are no win or lose conditions.      Theme Not Implemented: The core theme of &quot;Running out of space&quot; is not present. There is no pressure, no &quot;against the clock&quot; mechanic, and movement has no consequence or cost.      Suggestion for Improvement: The priority must be to implement the core gameplay loop and the specific challenge requirements.      Add a Main Menu: Create a simple start screen that allows the user to select the number of players (1-4).      Implement the Objective: Define and implement a clear goal (e.g., &quot;collect 5 items,&quot; &quot;reach an exit&quot;).      Implement the Theme: This is the most critical step. The &quot;Running out of space&quot; theme needs to be added. For example, movement should cost a resource, or tiles should disappear, creating the &quot;against the clock&quot; pressure that is currently missing.",

            "There are no extras to the game beyond what is requested as a basis in the exercise statement, but there is a &quot;hot to play&quot; section that allows the player to approach the game itself more effectively.",
            "Regarding optional game features, the game partially includes an &quot;against the clock&quot; mode due to the storm. However, I wouldn&#039;t classify it as an optional feature since it&#039;s an integral part of the main game and cannot be disabled. Another optional feature is a &quot;how to play&quot; menu, which is very useful for helping users understand the game before they start.      For potential improvements, I would suggest adding more difficulty levels. For example, on an easy setting, players could be required to collect fewer treasures, or the treasures could be located closer to the center of the map. On a hard mode, players would need to find more treasures, and these would be scattered more widely across the board.",
            "The window is a little strange when resizing it.      As a tip you could explore the Window strech mode in options in Project-&gt;Project Settings-&gt; Window",
        ],
        "design-feedback": [
            "Interesting game, some entropy in player movement caused by displacement between hexagons and the fact that the player can go outside the game window.      The storm part is not easy to understand. The game&#039;s objective is interesting and the scenario is too.      The code is poorly commented and a bit confusing. In addition, print messages still appear in debugging.",
            "There&#039;s nothing negative to point out. The game is a success in terms of design. The controls are intuitive, the gameplay is fun and engaging, it incorporates strategic elements, and the graphical assets fit the game&#039;s theme perfectly. Perhaps the only aspect that could be improved is the menu design. Although not the main focus, I believe they could have been more refined aesthetically. Simple changes, such as the font text or the background, would already represent a significant improvement.",
            "To have better &quot;meaningful choices&quot; I think that the game could have something more than moving the alien.      Overall, good game",
        ],
        "challenge-feedback": [
            "Interesting game concept with moving polygons characterizing the game differently from normal.      Despite this, the player&#039;s movement is sometimes confusing.      The storm part is not properly understandable and/or visible.      The game allows players to move off-screen.      It only allows one or two players.",
            "I enjoyed the game. Visually, it&#039;s very appealing and the gameplay is fun. However, I have two main criticisms: the game is limited to just one or two players and it has some bugs.      The most significant bug I encountered happens when I switch to fullscreen mode: the storm covers half of the board, making the game impossible to play.      As for improvements, I would suggest revising the treasure spawning system. Currently, treasures can appear in the far corners of the map, which makes completing the game very difficult. Perhaps this could be adjusted by introducing difficulty settings.",
            "Enjoyed the game! Good job.      In the next one, you already can also explore sound effects to make even better games.",
        ],
        "conceptdocument-feedback": [
            "Although all the requested sections exist, not all have the same title as requested, and the formal description component is not in mathematical notation.",
            "The concept document is well-written and includes all the required sections, which are clear and well-explained. My only suggestion is to rename the &#039;Theme&#039; section to &#039;Introductory Paragraph&#039; and the &#039;Implementation Reference&#039; to &#039;Formal Description&#039;.",
            "The Formal Description should be mathematical, https://home.uevora.pt/~fc/dj/91-extra_material/formal_game_description.html      Overall the document is well written and easy to understand.",
        ],
        "formal-feedback": [
            "The formal description component is not in mathematical notation, and the existing content is almost a summary of the code.",
            "The formal description in the concept document is generally well-written, covering all necessary points with few errors. However, I found the &quot;game setup&quot; section to be somewhat weak, as it does not specify which variables are initialized or what their starting values are. Another addition I would recommend for the entire formal description is the inclusion of mathematical formulas, which would help in evaluating the implementation more objectively.",
            "As said in last feedback, Formal Description should be more mathematical.            But very good game, good job!",

The assets are just simple colored cards, they could include images of a lake and palm trees for the oasis tile, wavy lines for the desert tile, and an animal sprite for a creature nest (like snake, scorpion, lizard, etc).            There does not seem to be any meaningfull choices since the only player action is drawing a tile and placing it on the map.

Still, the color selection works nicely and keeps everything consistent with the theme.      Good game overall.")], ["feedbacks", "1", "feedback"]) }], hash: {}

Points for Consideration (Bad Points): The main issue is a significant lack of clarity and missing features.
