### Feedback


#### Concept document feedback




---
The concept document is well-structured and includes most key elements. However, it could be improved by adding the goals that motivate the player, the core mechanics and dynamics, the elements of strategic choice along with their justification, and the skill/challenge balance. Including these aspects would provide a more complete and refined game design.

---
The concept document is extremely well done, yet it&#039;s missing aspect of it, like describing elements of strategic choice and skill/change balance.

---
The concept document is well-conceived, covering all the main points. However, the Implementation Reference could be more specific about the methods or classes used. The bullet points and feature list are well-detailed, covering all aspects the player will encounter while playing the game. The pitch line is enthusiastic, and the introduction provides a clear and concise summary of the game&#039;s objective.



#### Formal game description feedback




---
The formal game description in the document effectively covers the state, setup, views, player actions, victory conditions, and progression of play. However, it could be improved by specifying where these elements are located in the source code, making it easier for developers to navigate and understand the implementation.

---
The formal game description does provide with the code content for each aspect of the implementation.

---
The formal game description could provide more detail about the classes and methods used in the game. However, it effectively describes all the key points and aligns well with the applied logic, making it easy to locate the corresponding implementation in the code.



#### Implementation Feedback




---
Everything was found within the code, including the implementation and documentation of the game state, game setup, game views, player actions, victory conditions, and progress of play.

---
The implementation section of the concept document isn&#039;t done similar to how the teach has taught us. But, it manages to provide with information regarding each aspect of it well. But, I do believe it&#039;s best to follow with the format proposed by the teacher, which makes it less time consuming during the reading of the concept document.

---
The documentation provides a good summary of the main implementation points. However, the code logic for applying damage to the player or enemy could be improved. Instead of using fixed values, the player and enemy could have a parameter called &quot;attack&quot; that determines the damage they deal, rather than having the damage defined hard coded. The same approach could be applied to medical packs, allowing them to restore health based on a &quot;healing&quot; parameter. Additionally, the game view could be enhanced by including more details such as the number of keys the player has found.



#### Challenge Feedback




---
The game is very good. Its dynamics are engaging, and no major bugs were found, making it beta quality. Additionally, the theme of this game is Freedom.

---
The game follows the theme of &quot;freedom&quot;. While the game feels simplistic in nature, it provides a good challenge, while maintaining the theme and have a goal for the player. There isn&#039;t much to criticize in this section.

---
The game is simple and engaging with a clear objective. The player must find all four keys to unlock a chest and win the game. The keys are placed in different positions on the map, which is large enough that the player may sometimes feel lost. There are many enemies and health packs that help the player on their journey. I think the game could benefit from more maps with increasing difficulty. The controls are simple but lack the option for diagonal movement. Overall, it’s a good game.



#### Design Feedback




---
The only thing this game lacks are meaningful choices. However, it is fun to play, its goals are clear, and controlling the character is easy. The difficulty is well-suited to the target audience, and the assets align perfectly with the theme.

---
The game provides with a fun gameplay loop, which is a positive thing about it. While the controls are easy to use, the game&#039;s assets aren&#039;t all that well presented. It felt like it rushed the design and forgot about some parts, like the shadows are &quot;clipping&quot; through the floor, or the corners of the grass area don&#039;t exist. The game does provides a goal, yet the game doesn&#039;t show it. In fact, at the beginning of the game, the text tells the object, but was extremely small and pixelated that no player wouldn&#039;t see it clearly.

---
The game is fun, but the player’s movement could be less restricted by allowing diagonal controls. The difficulty is well-balanced featuring two main enemies that approach the player when close. The amount of damage taken is manageable enough to keep progressing in the game. The assets align well with the theme, featuring simple yet appealing animations that make the game engaging. The main goal of the game could be made clearer, as players may not realize they need to collect four keys to open a chest and escape.



#### Optional features feedback




---
There are no optional features implemented in this game.

---
The game lacks any optional features, like a hard mode, easy mode, against the clock mode, etc. Aspects like that can provide with more content for the player to enjoy, giving incentive to spend more time with it.

---
The game currently lacks optional features. Some potential additions could include a timeout to complete the game, additional difficulty modes requiring more keys to open the chest, and the inclusion of more enemies or stronger ones.

Positives                Clear and engaging pitch line that sets the game’s tone.          Well-structured feature list and formal description.          Difficulty tiers add strategic variety and motivation.            Improvements                Expand on Strategic Choices: Explain why specific mechanics (stealth, enemy AI) enhance the gameplay experience.          Clarify Skill Progression: Elaborate on how the game balances challenge as the player advances.          Add More Player Motivation: Consider introducing additional incentives, like achievements or unlockable content, to encourage replayability.

---
Good

---
Some points aren&#039;t described directly but are understood on other sections of the document



#### Formal game description feedback




---
Positives                The document effectively links gameplay elements to specific code functions.          The progression system is well-structured and logically implemented.          The player actions are clearly defined and mapped in the source code.            Improvements                Enhance Clarity: Expand explanations on how each function contributes to gameplay flow.          Refine Victory Conditions: Consider adding more details on how success/failure impacts future gameplay.          Improve Readability: Add more structure to descriptions, such as bullet points or step-by-step breakdowns.

---
Yes

---
Everything in the document is clear and can be found easily on the source code



#### Implementation Feedback




---
Positives                Well-documented game state, setup, and player actions.          Clear implementation of progression and enemy AI behavior.          Victory conditions are properly defined and linked to game flow.            Improvements                Enhance Code Comments: Add more inline comments in key functions for easier readability.          Optimize Player Movement: Improve control responsiveness to refine the stealth experience.

---
Very good

---
Implementation is clear and coincides with everything on the document



#### Challenge Feedback




---
I like the 3D design.

---
The game dynamic is good because you have to be smart to continue to be free of the guards who are looking for you.

---
Game is a lot of fun and the theme of Freedom fits perfectly



#### Design Feedback




---
Positives                Well-structured stealth mechanics that encourage strategy.          Meaningful choices in movement, distraction, and enemy avoidance.          Clear objectives and difficulty levels to challenge players.            Improvements                Refine Controls: Improve responsiveness for smoother player movement.          Enhance Player Feedback: Provide clearer UI cues for key actions like hiding and unlocking doors.          Increase Replayability: Introduce random enemy patrols or alternate escape routes for variety.

---
The controls are simple and you get a button prompt to pick up objects, open chests and open doors. The choices of running and going after the key or approaching the game with caution are meaningful because if the guards detect you, you are most probably going to die.Overall a fun experience

---
Game is fun to play and can be a bit hard at times which can be engaging fo players to try and beat those harder levels, whoever in the earlier levels the guards can almost be ignored



#### Optional features feedback




---
Positives                Difficulty levels (Gold, Silver, Bronze) provide a scalable challenge.          The time-based ranking system adds replayability.          Map codes make progression more flexible.            Improvements                More Customization: Allow players to set difficulty modifiers, such as reduced enemy detection or extra time.          Bonus Challenges: Introduce optional stealth objectives (e.g., complete without being spotted for extra rewards).          Adaptive Difficulty: Consider scaling difficulty based on player performance for a more personalized experience.

---
No hard mode, no easy mode, those are necessary. Optional features are good like the AI of the guards and the pickable objects.

---
Each level is timed and a scoreboard in the main menu displays the best time which makes the game replayable to try and achieve the best time possible and even competitive

### Feedback


#### Concept document feedback




---
Still needs to be clarified

---
Document is well structured and everything was easy to find and understand

---
The concept document only lack some information about the skill/change balance and the strategic choices. Despite the strategic choices being mentioned, the are not much information about them. You also talk about the players improving their skill but you directly don&#039;t mentioned the skill/change balance.



#### Formal game description feedback




---
No direct references to the code are made

---
Most of the points explained what happened and how it worked but lacked the location in the source code although most of that was easy to find

---
Since the game state is inconclusive, i could not find an implementation of it. You should have reference that in each moment the game state has the players and enemies positions and the coins acquired by the them. The progress of play was not implemented since you say that the game has no level progression, but it exist a game progression in each loop game that says if a player died or not and if someone has reached the end game. The player&#039;s actions, victory conditions, game setup and game views are presented in the code and  in the formal game description.



#### Implementation Feedback




---
Only the game setup and the player actions are explicitly present in the code.

---
Most of the points were easy to find and lined up with the documentation, the only point that wasn&#039;t well explained was the game state although it wasn&#039;t very hard to find the implementation

---
I found the information about these points in the documentation, and since they don&#039;t have any mathematical expression they were also in the code. The progress of play was not implemented since you say that the game has no level progression, but it exist a game progression in each loop game. The game state is not correctly documented, but the information you have in it, is presented in the game.



#### Challenge Feedback




---
The camera placement is bad and affects the progression of the level

---
I don&#039;t think the game fits well in the theme freedom as the player is not running away or escaping from something, this is more of a race game

---
The game is very fun to play and the competitiveness keeps the players engaged. There are no errors and the theme is within the requirement(freedom).



#### Design Feedback




---
So the game requires players to explore the level. The second camera angle needs to be fixed

---
While the controls for player 1 were easy to understand and there were signs explaining them the controls for player 2 were nowhere to be found. Despite the movement was easy to figure out, I had to randomly press buttons to find which made the player 2 jump.

---
The game is fun to play and the goal might appear not clear, but as soon as we start playing we realize what we must do and what is the objective. The competitiveness and the game mechanics and dynamics keep the player motivated and engaged. We have the freedom to choose a path and to try to beat the adversary. The assets match the theme and the difficulty is adequate.



#### Optional features feedback




---
Adding these modes would be good.

---
Featuring a split-screen multiplayer makes the game much more enjoyable

---
Despite the game not having a easy, hard or against the clock mode, it possesses a optional feature. This feature allows the 2 player to play against each other repetitively.

### Feedback


#### Concept document feedback




---
The concept document does not have any pitch line. There are a conclusion, but not any introduction to the game.The demographic breakdown lacks information like the intended platforms and the genre of the game. I also could not found any formal description of the game in the document. The concept document outlines all other necessary points.

---
The concept document lacks a pitch line, an introductory paragraph, a bullet-list feature list with its breakdown, and a formal game description. These are all crucial elements for understanding the game, its mechanics, and how everything functions in the &#039;background.&#039; Despite these missing components, the document does include the player goals, core mechanics and dynamics, elements of strategic choice, and the skill/balance changes, which are essential for understanding the game&#039;s design. Including the missing elements would provide a more complete overview, making it easier for developers and players to grasp the full scope of the game.

---
Concept document explains all points of the game but some of them are poorly explained, moslty just pointing what that section is about but not explaining how it was implemented



#### Formal game description feedback




---
I could not found the formal game description section, but indirectly i could retrieve some informations like the player actions and the game views. The victory conditions i could only found in the source code. The rest of the required information i could not found.

---
Since there is no formal game description, it doesn&#039;t describe nor locate the things mentioned above. This absence makes it difficult to understand how these elements fit together within the overall game design and gameplay.

---
Like mentioned previously the document explains briefly what was implemented but not how it was implement nor where in the code. And some points are even missing on the document



#### Implementation Feedback




---
I couldn&#039;t find these sections specifically in the document, but for some of them they were present. In  the code and in the documentation i couldn&#039;t find any information about the game state or the game setup. In the documentation i could understand what are the game views and what are the player actions. The progression of play i could not found in the documentation and in the code, but the victory conditions i just found in the code.

---
It took me some time to find the implementation and documentation for the game state, game setup, game views, player actions, victory conditions, and the progress of play. Even after a while, I couldn&#039;t find everything fully documented or completed. It would be helpful to have clearer, more accessible documentation that outlines these components in a more organized way. This could prevent delays and confusion, especially for new developers or players trying to understand the game&#039;s structure. Additionally, providing more detailed documentation on areas like game views or victory conditions could improve the overall development experience and make the game easier to understand.

---
After looking for some time I was able to found the implementation but it is a bit confusing as there are some aspects that didn&#039;t seem to make into the game but are still present in the code and also some naming conventions aren&#039;t clear which made the implementation confusing



#### Challenge Feedback




---
The theme of the game is freedom and does not present any errors. The dynamic is interesting and keeps the player engaged.

---
The game’s dynamics are quite engaging, and the theme of freedom is well represented. However, there are some bugs that need to be addressed to enhance the overall experience.

---
The game fits well the Freedom theme but seems to be lacking on the level designs as there seems to be missing the challenge players need to face to complete the game



#### Design Feedback




---
While the game play offers a degree of fun, because the straightforward win condition, requiring only forward movement without enemy encounters, limits strategic depth and player engagement; the lack of player aiming control reduces the sense of challenge. The assets could be better, since in some cases they don&#039;t match, like the freedom direction and the rest of the arena. Some musics/sounds could be added to increase the player&#039;s excitement. The controls are easy to use, the difficulty is adequate, there are meaningful choices and the goal is clear.

---
The game is partially fun to play, but as mentioned before, there are some bugs that hinder the player’s experience, making it less enjoyable. The mechanics and dynamics manage to keep the player engaged for a while, and there are meaningful choices, such as selecting between easy and hard modes, which do impact gameplay. The controls are easy to use, the assets align well with the theme, and the difficulty level is appropriate for the target audience.

---
The game goal is clear and the player has some control on how the game plays depending on the difficulty they choose but like was said on the previous point, lacks the challenge as there are no enemies or they are to far from the actual game scene to represent a challenge which makes the game boring to play



#### Optional features feedback




---
The game presents a easy and a hard mode. For each mode some attributes of the enemies are changed and the freedom exit is also different.

---
The game includes an easy and a hard mode, but beyond that, it lacks an &#039;against the clock&#039; mode or any other optional features that could add variety and replayability. Introducing additional game modes or optional challenges could significantly enhance the player experience by offering more ways to engage with the game.

---
The menu to choose game difficulty is in-game, meaning you move the character to choose the difficulty which is a nice way to do it compared to the classic menu

### Feedback


#### Concept document feedback




---
Positives                Clear game premise with a strong pitch line.          Defined player motivation with an engaging adventure theme.          Simple and effective mechanics suitable for the target audience.            Improvements                Expand feature breakdown: Explain how each mechanic enhances gameplay.          Clarify strategic choices: Justify why players need to make meaningful decisions.          Improve skill progression: Detail how difficulty evolves over time to keep players engaged.

---
Elements still missing

---
The concept document is well-structured, featuring a strong pitch line and a clear, concise introductory paragraph. However, the feature list could be more detailed by including the game modes. The implementation reference is straightforward and covers all the main points, but it could benefit from additional details about the classes used.



#### Formal game description feedback




---
Positives                Clearly maps game elements to the code for easy reference.          Defines player actions and goals effectively.          Basic mechanics are well-explained and aligned with the code.            Improvements                Expand UI details: Describe how player feedback (e.g., health, enemy count) is presented.          Improve progression explanation: Clarify how the game evolves (e.g., increasing difficulty, new mechanics).          Consider alternative victory conditions: Add more depth beyond defeating all slimes.

---
The concept document does not have direct references to the code

---
The concept document provides information about the state, setup, views, actions, victory, and progression, explaining the applied logic for each point in a direct manner. The information is simple and easy to understand but could include more detailed explanations about the classes, methods used, and the overall logic flow. This additional detail would be helpful, even though the logic is straightforward enough to follow through the code.



#### Implementation Feedback




---
Positives                Core game logic is well-structured and clearly implemented.          Victory and defeat conditions are functional and properly linked to the game loop.          Player actions are straightforward and responsive.            Improvements                Enhance UI feedback: Display health bars, remaining slimes, or a progress tracker for better player awareness.          Expand progression mechanics: Introduce level-ups, enemy scaling, or unlockable abilities to create a more engaging experience.          Improve documentation clarity: Add more comments in key functions for better readability and easier debugging.

---
Good enough

---
The implementation is easy to follow because the logic is simple. The code is reasonably organized, with a few small improvements to be made, such as the difficulty selection methods that contain repetitive code. One thing that needs to be changed is the fact that the player decides the amount of damage taken, this could be parameterized within the enemy class.



#### Challenge Feedback




---
Positives                Classic and accessible gameplay: The game’s simple mechanics make it easy to pick up and play.          Exploration element: A variety of environments (forests, ruins) encourages movement and discovery.          Clear victory conditions: The objective of defeating all slimes is straightforward.            Improvements                Enhance the sense of freedom: Introduce multiple paths to victory, such as alternative goals (e.g., diplomacy, resource collection).          Improve game dynamics: Add mechanics like different enemy behaviors, boss fights, or item pickups to keep combat engaging.          Clarify game completeness: Ensure all mechanics function properly and consider including a testing phase for balancing difficulty.

---
Very good game of freedom

---
The game&#039;s objective is simple  (eliminate all the slimes on the map). There are minor bugs when the player attacks while moving, as well as some graphical z-index issues. The map is quite large, but the game screen only displays a small portion of it, which can make it easy for the player to get lost. Overall, the game is not bad, but it could benefit from additional features.



#### Design Feedback




---
Positives                Simple and accessible gameplay suitable for younger audiences.          Clear goals and structured combat make the game easy to understand.          Retro pixel-art assets complement the game’s theme.            Improvements                Add gameplay variety: Introduce new enemy types, boss fights, or special abilities to make combat more engaging.          Increase meaningful choices: Implement power-ups or defensive strategies to offer different ways to play.          Improve difficulty balance: Consider adaptive difficulty based on player performance to enhance long-term engagement.

---
No errors here

---
The assets align well with the game&#039;s theme and objective, creating an enjoyable environment complemented by pleasant background music. The difficulty is appropriately adjusted for the target demographic, but the game feels too easy because health is restored very quickly. The controls are intuitive, but the game lacks information on which keys perform specific actions. While the goal is simple, there is no in-game information about the objective, and in my opinion, it misses important details, such as how many slimes are left to kill.



#### Optional features feedback




---
Positives                Core mechanics work well, providing a foundation for expansion.          Straightforward combat and exploration make the game accessible to younger players.            Improvements                Add difficulty modes: Implement an easy and hard mode to cater to different player skill levels.          Introduce a time-based challenge: Consider an optional mode where players must defeat slimes within a time limit.          Expand optional content: Include collectibles, power-ups, or achievements to enhance replayability.

---
Other optional features and against the clock mode missing

---
There are some optional features in the game, such as three different difficulty modes. The differences between the modes are based on the amount of damage the player takes and deals. However, when playing the game, the differences between the modes are not very noticeable. Additional features that could be added include a timeout clock requiring the player to kill all the enemies before time runs out, or a timed mode where the player must kill a defined number of slimes. In this mode, slimes could respawn in different locations after being defeated.

### Feedback


#### Concept document feedback




---
The concept document is well-structured in several key areas. It includes a pitch line, an introductory paragraph, a demographic breakdown, a bullet-list feature list, a feature-list breakdown, and a formal game description, all of which are error-free. However, there are significant gaps in crucial sections. The document does not describe the goals that motivate the player, the core mechanics and dynamics, the elements of strategic choice or the reasons for including them, nor the skill/balance change. These missing components are critical, as they are essential for understanding the depth of the gameplay and how the game engages players. The absence of this information leaves important aspects of the game unclear and makes it harder to fully grasp its design and experience.

---
The concept has all the required key points, with only one missing. The description of the skill/change balance is not presented. I could not found any information about the skill/change balance.

---
Despite the implementation section was lacking, the rest of the concept document was well done, but it did missed some aspects, like describing the elements of strategic choice and the skill/change balance. Outside of that, the rest of it meets the expectations of a concept document.



#### Formal game description feedback




---
The formal game description does a good job of describing and locating the game setup, game views, player actions, and the progression of play in the source code, with no errors. However, it does not describe or locate the victory conditions in the source code, which is a critical omission. Despite this, by playing the game and reviewing the &#039;Condições de Vitória&#039; section in the feature breakdown, it is possible to infer the victory conditions. This lack of direct description in the formal game documentation makes it less accessible for developers or team members who rely solely on the documentation to understand the full scope of the game.

---
I could not found any information about the game state in your game or in your document and the progression of play is not very clear in the documentation, although that information is visible in the code. All the remaining sections are in the code and in the document.

---
It&#039;s needs to be better explained, with a few lines of your code inserted in your document.



#### Implementation Feedback




---
After looking at the code, I quickly discovered the player actions and the victory conditions, both of which were well-documented with no errors. However, when I searched for the implementation and documentation for the game state, game setup, game views, and progress of play, I found that some parts were missing or incomplete. There were some errors in the available documentation, but none of them were critical. Due to this incomplete information, I couldn’t fully locate or understand these components, which made it harder to get a complete view of the game&#039;s structure. Despite this, the well-documented player actions and victory conditions made it easier to grasp the core aspects of the gameplay.

---
I could not found any information about the game state in your game or in your document and the progression of play is not very clear in the documentation. The victory conditions, player actions, game views and game setup are clear in the documentation and in the code.

---
The implementation section of the concept document feels extremely lacking. It doesn&#039;t follow the example given by the teacher during classes, but it doesn&#039;t exactly give enough information regarding each subsection. It needs to be better explained and rely less on using text and more on the use of pseudo code to relay each point.



#### Challenge Feedback




---
This game is very good. The dynamics are engaging, and its theme revolves around freedom. There are no major bugs, which makes it beta quality.

---
This engaging game explores the theme of freedom and features strategic gameplay that captivates players.

---
The game fails to follow with the theme of &quot;freedom&quot;. As in, it fails to provide player with freedom in how they approach the challenge the game offers. While it is of beta quality, it needed more paths for the player to take besides just one specific.



#### Design Feedback




---
As said before, this game is very good. The game is fun to play, with no errors encountered during testing. The player’s goals are clear and well-defined, ensuring that players know exactly what they need to accomplish. The mechanics and dynamics keep the player motivated and engaged throughout the gameplay, with smooth and intuitive controls that make the game easy to pick up. There are meaningful choices that add depth to the experience, allowing players to feel in control of their decisions. The assets, including characters, animations, and other visual elements, match the game’s theme perfectly, enhancing the overall experience. Finally, the game’s difficulty is appropriately tailored to the target demographic, offering a challenge that is neither too easy nor too difficult.

---
The game is fun to play and the goal is clear. The strategy keeps the player engaged and motivated and allow them to make meaningful choices. The controls are also easy to discover and to use. The difficulty is adequate but the game could have some sounds and music to keep the player more excited. The animation of the player is not visible if we make short distances like one click in each direction at a time.

---
Even though the game doesn&#039;t offer much when it comes to being a fun experience, it&#039;s overall design matches the theme. It has easy controls, the assets match the them and the difficulty is adequate for the target audience the author wanted the game to be for. The goals are clear but, as I said before, it needs to offer meaningful choices, otherwise the game will feel the same each time the player replays the game.



#### Optional features feedback




---
The game doesn&#039;t feature an easy or hard mode, only a normal mode. It does offer a timed mode, but it&#039;s not an &#039;against the clock&#039; mode. Instead, it&#039;s a different mode that tracks the time the player takes to finish the game, providing a way to challenge completion speed but not in the traditional sense of racing against a timer during gameplay

---
The game does not have a against the clock, hard or easy mode, but possesses a time mode, where the player can try to beat his time. The best time is not being saved, preventing the player to check what score to beat. There is a normal mode where the player can practice and play the game for fun.

---
The game doesn&#039;t offer no easy or hard mode, but offers an against the clock mode, which allows to compete with friends on who finishes the game in less time. I didn&#039;t find any other optional features that might be relevant to mention. Having an easy and hard mode can provide with more content for the experience. With this game, he could make the hard mode by having the map more complicated to go through.

### Feedback


#### Concept document feedback




---
Positives                Well-structured and detailed breakdown of game mechanics and features.          Clear and engaging player motivation centered around survival and progression.          Defined target audience and platform support help position the game effectively.            Improvements                Expand on strategic choices: Explain how different player actions affect long-term survival.          Clarify skill progression: Describe how enemies or challenges scale to match player experience.          Include more variation in difficulty: Suggest optional gameplay paths or adaptive mechanics to keep engagement high.

---
The concept document is well done, can explain well what the game is about, but it does lack a clear goal for the player to engage with the game.

---
The Concept Document is complete, providing a thorough explanation of the game structure and the logic behind key decisions. The feature list is also complete, but some features do not work as intended during gameplay due to issues in the implementation. While the explanation of the logic used in the implementation is accurate, it could benefit from additional detail.



#### Formal game description feedback




---
Positives                Clear mapping of gameplay elements to source code functions.          Well-structured progression system that dynamically increases difficulty.          Detailed documentation on player actions and combat mechanics.            Improvements                Expand explanations on enemy scaling: Provide more details on how enemy strength evolves over time.          Enhance UI clarity: Describe additional feedback elements for the player (e.g., damage indicators, wave progression).          Consider alternative victory conditions: Introduce optional goals beyond survival, such as milestones or achievements.

---
Each element of the implementation are presented well, so there&#039;s no need to be critical about it.

---
The formal description identifies and locates all the main points in the code, presenting code snippets that correspond to the actual implementation. It includes brief and direct explanations of what each method or class does but could provide more detail about the overall logic flow.



#### Implementation Feedback




---
Positives                Well-documented code with clear references to player state and enemy behaviors.          Smooth progression system that increases difficulty dynamically.          Effective HUD implementation for real-time player feedback.            Improvements                Enhance game state tracking: Add more feedback elements like a progress meter for wave completion.          Improve variety in progression: Introduce new challenges, such as boss fights or changing environments.          Expand victory conditions: Consider alternative win scenarios beyond simple survival (e.g., reaching a level milestone).

---
The Concept Document contains the implementation section. While it isn&#039;t how it&#039;s usually done (according to how the teacher has done), it manages to explain how each aspect of it works. But, it&#039;s important to do it in a way that makes it easier for others to read, especially to people who have no coding knowledge.

---
The overall implementation is fine, with all the main points addressed and logic that is easy to follow, supported by well-named methods. However, there are some issues in the code, such as unused multiplayer functionality, a non-dynamic player level update that does not affect gameplay, and the lack of enemy respawn even when all of them are dead. Additionally, there is a problem with the game screen size when restarting the game. These issues indicate that the game is not yet fully complete



#### Challenge Feedback




---
Improvements                Expand player choices: Add alternative progression paths or strategies beyond pure combat.          Enhance the freedom theme: Introduce more exploration elements or branching paths.          Improve enemy variety: Different attack patterns or behaviors could keep the combat fresh.

---
While the game follows the theme of &quot;Freedom&quot; he failed to provide a full game to take advantage of it. Even though the mechanics of it are there and there&#039;s a good concept out of it, it still failed to provide a fullfiling experience for the player. The best to do is to have a clear objective for the game, while still following the theme.

---
The objective of the game is unclear. After defeating the enemies, there is nothing left to do. Additionally, the menu displays a label for selecting the number of players, even though the game is single-player. The assets are fine, and the controls are reasonable. However, one issue that affects the game&#039;s quality is that if the player dies and restarts the game, the game screen becomes very small.



#### Design Feedback




---
Positives                Fast-paced and engaging combat mechanics.          Well-structured difficulty scaling that maintains challenge.          Pixel-art assets align well with the game’s theme.            Improvements                Introduce more meaningful choices: Add power-ups, different abilities, or alternate strategies beyond combat.          Enhance enemy variety: Different attack patterns or behaviors could make battles more dynamic.          Expand level diversity: Introduce environmental interactions or unique hazards to keep gameplay fresh.

---
The only positive aspect of the game design is that the controls are easy and that the assets match the theme of &quot;freedom&quot;. Aside from that, the game is lacking. There&#039;s no goals, no meaningful choices and no motivation. You might say that it lacks the &quot;fun factor&quot;. To solve that, the game needs a clear goal for the player to engage with the game, something that &quot;motivates&quot; him/her into go through the game until the end.

---
This is an arcade game where the objective is to survive and kill enemies. However, the game does not function as intended because the number of enemies in the scene does not regenerate. As a result, the game lacks the ability to motivate and engage the player to continue playing. The difficulty is fine and appropriately balanced, and the assets match the theme well. The game is not enjoyable due to its shortcomings



#### Optional features feedback




---
Positives                The progressive difficulty system naturally increases the challenge over time.          The leveling mechanic encourages long-term engagement.            Improvements                Add difficulty modes: Allow players to choose easy, normal, or hard for a tailored experience.          Include a time-based challenge mode: Introduce an optional mode where players must defeat enemies within a set time limit.          Expand optional content: Implement unlockable skills, special challenges, or bonus objectives for replayability.

---
The game lacks any of the optional features, like hard mode, easy mode, against the clock, etc. There isn&#039;t much to say about it besides that having any of those optional features can increase the challenge of the game, which provides with more content for the player to enjoy.

---
There are no optional features in the game. Some additional features that could be added, considering it is an arcade game:  include a timed mode where the player must kill a certain number of enemies within a set time limit. This could be further enhanced by introducing different difficulty modes that define the number of enemies and the time limit.
