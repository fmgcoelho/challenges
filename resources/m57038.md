### Feedback

#### Design Feedback


Positives -- Well-structured stealth mechanics that encourage strategy.          Meaningful choices in movement, distraction, and enemy avoidance.          Clear objectives and difficulty levels to challenge players.            Improvements                Refine Controls: Improve responsiveness for smoother player movement.          Enhance Player Feedback: Provide clearer UI cues for key actions like hiding and unlocking doors.          Increase Replayability: Introduce random enemy patrols or alternate escape routes for variety.

----


The controls are simple and you get a button prompt to pick up objects, open chests and open doors. The choices of running and going after the key or approaching the game with caution are meaningful because if the guards detect you, you are most probably going to die.Overall a fun experience

----


Game is fun to play and can be a bit hard at times which can be engaging fo players to try and beat those harder levels, whoever in the earlier levels the guards can almost be ignored

----

#### Formal Feedback


Positives -- The document effectively links gameplay elements to specific code functions.          The progression system is well-structured and logically implemented.          The player actions are clearly defined and mapped in the source code.            Improvements                Enhance Clarity: Expand explanations on how each function contributes to gameplay flow.          Refine Victory Conditions: Consider adding more details on how success/failure impacts future gameplay.          Improve Readability: Add more structure to descriptions, such as bullet points or step-by-step breakdowns.

----


Yes

----


Everything in the document is clear and can be found easily on the source code

----

#### Challenge Feedback


I like the 3D design.

----


The game dynamic is good because you have to be smart to continue to be free of the guards who are looking for you.

----


Game is a lot of fun and the theme of Freedom fits perfectly

----

#### Implementation Feedback


Positives -- Well-documented game state, setup, and player actions.          Clear implementation of progression and enemy AI behavior.          Victory conditions are properly defined and linked to game flow.            Improvements                Enhance Code Comments: Add more inline comments in key functions for easier readability.          Optimize Player Movement: Improve control responsiveness to refine the stealth experience.          Expand Victory System: Consider adding alternative success conditions, like bonus rewards for undetected runs.

----


Very good

----


Implementation is clear and coincides with everything on the document

----

#### Optional Feedback


Positives -- Difficulty levels (Gold, Silver, Bronze) provide a scalable challenge.          The time-based ranking system adds replayability.          Map codes make progression more flexible.            Improvements                More Customization: Allow players to set difficulty modifiers, such as reduced enemy detection or extra time.          Bonus Challenges: Introduce optional stealth objectives (e.g., complete without being spotted for extra rewards).          Adaptive Difficulty: Consider scaling difficulty based on player performance for a more personalized experience.

----


No hard mode, no easy mode, those are necessary. Optional features are good like the AI of the guards and the pickable objects.

----


Each level is timed and a scoreboard in the main menu displays the best time which makes the game replayable to try and achieve the best time possible and even competitive

----

#### Conceptdoc Feedback


Positives -- Clear and engaging pitch line that sets the gameâ€™s tone.          Well-structured feature list and formal description.          Difficulty tiers add strategic variety and motivation.            Improvements                Expand on Strategic Choices: Explain why specific mechanics (stealth, enemy AI) enhance the gameplay experience.          Clarify Skill Progression: Elaborate on how the game balances challenge as the player advances.          Add More Player Motivation: Consider introducing additional incentives, like achievements or unlockable content, to encourage replayability.

----
