### Feedback

#### Design Feedback


Positives -- Fast-paced and engaging combat mechanics.          Well-structured difficulty scaling that maintains challenge.          Pixel-art assets align well with the gameâ€™s theme.            Improvements                Introduce more meaningful choices: Add power-ups, different abilities, or alternate strategies beyond combat.          Enhance enemy variety: Different attack patterns or behaviors could make battles more dynamic.          Expand level diversity: Introduce environmental interactions or unique hazards to keep gameplay fresh.

----


The only positive aspect of the game design is that the controls are easy and that the assets match the theme of &amp;quot;freedom&amp;quot;. Aside from that, the game is lacking. There&amp;#039;s no goals, no meaningful choices and no motivation. You might say that it lacks the &amp;quot;fun factor&amp;quot;. To solve that, the game needs a clear goal for the player to engage with the game, something that &amp;quot;motivates&amp;quot; him/her into go through the game until the end.

----


This is an arcade game where the objective is to survive and kill enemies. However, the game does not function as intended because the number of enemies in the scene does not regenerate. As a result, the game lacks the ability to motivate and engage the player to continue playing. The difficulty is fine and appropriately balanced, and the assets match the theme well. The game is not enjoyable due to its shortcomings

----

#### Formal Feedback


Positives -- Clear mapping of gameplay elements to source code functions.          Well-structured progression system that dynamically increases difficulty.          Detailed documentation on player actions and combat mechanics.            Improvements                Expand explanations on enemy scaling: Provide more details on how enemy strength evolves over time.          Enhance UI clarity: Describe additional feedback elements for the player (e.g., damage indicators, wave progression).          Consider alternative victory conditions: Introduce optional goals beyond survival, such as milestones or achievements.

----


Each element of the implementation are presented well, so there&amp;#039;s no need to be critical about it.

----


The formal description identifies and locates all the main points in the code, presenting code snippets that correspond to the actual implementation. It includes brief and direct explanations of what each method or class does but could provide more detail about the overall logic flow.

----

#### Challenge Feedback


Improvements -- Expand player choices: Add alternative progression paths or strategies beyond pure combat.          Enhance the freedom theme: Introduce more exploration elements or branching paths.          Improve enemy variety: Different attack patterns or behaviors could keep the combat fresh.

----


While the game follows the theme of &amp;quot;Freedom&amp;quot; he failed to provide a full game to take advantage of it. Even though the mechanics of it are there and there&amp;#039;s a good concept out of it, it still failed to provide a fullfiling experience for the player. The best to do is to have a clear objective for the game, while still following the theme.

----


The objective of the game is unclear. After defeating the enemies, there is nothing left to do. Additionally, the menu displays a label for selecting the number of players, even though the game is single-player. The assets are fine, and the controls are reasonable. However, one issue that affects the game&amp;#039;s quality is that if the player dies and restarts the game, the game screen becomes very small.

----

#### Implementation Feedback


Positives -- Well-documented code with clear references to player state and enemy behaviors.          Smooth progression system that increases difficulty dynamically.          Effective HUD implementation for real-time player feedback.            Improvements                Enhance game state tracking: Add more feedback elements like a progress meter for wave completion.          Improve variety in progression: Introduce new challenges, such as boss fights or changing environments.          Expand victory conditions: Consider alternative win scenarios beyond simple survival (e.g., reaching a level milestone).

----


The Concept Document contains the implementation section. While it isn&amp;#039;t how it&amp;#039;s usually done (according to how the teacher has done), it manages to explain how each aspect of it works. But, it&amp;#039;s important to do it in a way that makes it easier for others to read, especially to people who have no coding knowledge.

----


The overall implementation is fine, with all the main points addressed and logic that is easy to follow, supported by well-named methods. However, there are some issues in the code, such as unused multiplayer functionality, a non-dynamic player level update that does not affect gameplay, and the lack of enemy respawn even when all of them are dead. Additionally, there is a problem with the game screen size when restarting the game. These issues indicate that the game is not yet fully complete

----

#### Optional Feedback


Positives -- The progressive difficulty system naturally increases the challenge over time.          The leveling mechanic encourages long-term engagement.            Improvements                Add difficulty modes: Allow players to choose easy, normal, or hard for a tailored experience.          Include a time-based challenge mode: Introduce an optional mode where players must defeat enemies within a set time limit.          Expand optional content: Implement unlockable skills, special challenges, or bonus objectives for replayability.

----


The game lacks any of the optional features, like hard mode, easy mode, against the clock, etc. There isn&amp;#039;t much to say about it besides that having any of those optional features can increase the challenge of the game, which provides with more content for the player to enjoy.

----


There are no optional features in the game. Some additional features that could be added, considering it is an arcade game:  include a timed mode where the player must kill a certain number of enemies within a set time limit. This could be further enhanced by introducing different difficulty modes that define the number of enemies and the time limit.

----

#### Conceptdoc Feedback


Positives -- Well-structured and detailed breakdown of game mechanics and features.          Clear and engaging player motivation centered around survival and progression.          Defined target audience and platform support help position the game effectively.            Improvements                Expand on strategic choices: Explain how different player actions affect long-term survival.          Clarify skill progression: Describe how enemies or challenges scale to match player experience.          Include more variation in difficulty: Suggest optional gameplay paths or adaptive mechanics to keep engagement high.

----


The concept document is well done, can explain well what the game is about, but it does lack a clear goal for the player to engage with the game.

----


The Concept Document is complete, providing a thorough explanation of the game structure and the logic behind key decisions. The feature list is also complete, but some features do not work as intended during gameplay due to issues in the implementation. While the explanation of the logic used in the implementation is accurate, it could benefit from additional detail.
