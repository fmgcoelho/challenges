There were some errors in the available documentation, but none of them were critical. Due to this incomplete information, I couldn’t fully locate or understand these components, which made it harder to get a complete view of the game&#039;s structure.

The document does not describe the goals that motivate the player, the core mechanics and dynamics, the elements of strategic choice or the reasons for including them, nor the skill/balance change. These missing components are critical, as they are essential for understanding the depth of the gameplay and how the game engages players.

As a result, the game lacks the ability to motivate and engage the player to continue playing. The difficulty is fine and appropriately balanced, and the assets match the theme well. The game is not enjoyable due to its shortcomings","YES. No errors.","YES. No errors.","YES. No errors.","YES. No errors.","YES. No errors.","YES. No errors.","The overall implementation is fine, with all the main points addressed and logic that is easy to follow, supported by well-named methods. However, there are some issues in the code, such as unused multiplayer functionality, a non-dynamic player level update that does not affect gameplay, and the lack of enemy respawn even when all of them are dead. Additionally, there is a problem with the game screen size when restarting the game. These issues indicate that the game is not yet fully complete","NO. There are critical errors.","NO.

Some additional features that could be added, considering it is an arcade game:  include a timed mode where the player must kill a certain number of enemies within a set time limit. This could be further enhanced by introducing different difficulty modes that define the number of enemies and the time limit.","YES. No errors.","YES. No errors.","YES. No errors.","YES.

The feature list is also complete, but some features do not work as intended during gameplay due to issues in the implementation.
