<h3 id="feedback">Feedback</h3>
<h4 id="concept-document-feedback">Concept document feedback</h4>
<hr />
<p>The concept document is well-structured and includes most key
elements. However, it could be improved by adding the goals that
motivate the player, the core mechanics and dynamics, the elements of
strategic choice along with their justification, and the skill/challenge
balance. Including these aspects would provide a more complete and
refined game design.</p>
<hr />
<p>The concept document is extremely well done, yet it's missing aspect
of it, like describing elements of strategic choice and skill/change
balance.</p>
<hr />
<p>The concept document is well-conceived, covering all the main points.
However, the Implementation Reference could be more specific about the
methods or classes used. The bullet points and feature list are
well-detailed, covering all aspects the player will encounter while
playing the game. The pitch line is enthusiastic, and the introduction
provides a clear and concise summary of the game's objective.</p>
<h4 id="formal-game-description-feedback">Formal game description
feedback</h4>
<hr />
<p>The formal game description in the document effectively covers the
state, setup, views, player actions, victory conditions, and progression
of play. However, it could be improved by specifying where these
elements are located in the source code, making it easier for developers
to navigate and understand the implementation.</p>
<hr />
<p>The formal game description does provide with the code content for
each aspect of the implementation.</p>
<hr />
<p>The formal game description could provide more detail about the
classes and methods used in the game. However, it effectively describes
all the key points and aligns well with the applied logic, making it
easy to locate the corresponding implementation in the code.</p>
<h4 id="implementation-feedback">Implementation Feedback</h4>
<hr />
<p>Everything was found within the code, including the implementation
and documentation of the game state, game setup, game views, player
actions, victory conditions, and progress of play.</p>
<hr />
<p>The implementation section of the concept document isn't done similar
to how the teach has taught us. But, it manages to provide with
information regarding each aspect of it well. But, I do believe it's
best to follow with the format proposed by the teacher, which makes it
less time consuming during the reading of the concept document.</p>
<hr />
<p>The documentation provides a good summary of the main implementation
points. However, the code logic for applying damage to the player or
enemy could be improved. Instead of using fixed values, the player and
enemy could have a parameter called "attack" that determines the damage
they deal, rather than having the damage defined hard coded. The same
approach could be applied to medical packs, allowing them to restore
health based on a "healing" parameter. Additionally, the game view could
be enhanced by including more details such as the number of keys the
player has found.</p>
<h4 id="challenge-feedback">Challenge Feedback</h4>
<hr />
<p>The game is very good. Its dynamics are engaging, and no major bugs
were found, making it beta quality. Additionally, the theme of this game
is Freedom.</p>
<hr />
<p>The game follows the theme of "freedom". While the game feels
simplistic in nature, it provides a good challenge, while maintaining
the theme and have a goal for the player. There isn't much to criticize
in this section.</p>
<hr />
<p>The game is simple and engaging with a clear objective. The player
must find all four keys to unlock a chest and win the game. The keys are
placed in different positions on the map, which is large enough that the
player may sometimes feel lost. There are many enemies and health packs
that help the player on their journey. I think the game could benefit
from more maps with increasing difficulty. The controls are simple but
lack the option for diagonal movement. Overall, it’s a good game.</p>
<h4 id="design-feedback">Design Feedback</h4>
<hr />
<p>The only thing this game lacks are meaningful choices. However, it is
fun to play, its goals are clear, and controlling the character is easy.
The difficulty is well-suited to the target audience, and the assets
align perfectly with the theme.</p>
<hr />
<p>The game provides with a fun gameplay loop, which is a positive thing
about it. While the controls are easy to use, the game's assets aren't
all that well presented. It felt like it rushed the design and forgot
about some parts, like the shadows are "clipping" through the floor, or
the corners of the grass area don't exist. The game does provides a
goal, yet the game doesn't show it. In fact, at the beginning of the
game, the text tells the object, but was extremely small and pixelated
that no player wouldn't see it clearly.</p>
<hr />
<p>The game is fun, but the player’s movement could be less restricted
by allowing diagonal controls. The difficulty is well-balanced featuring
two main enemies that approach the player when close. The amount of
damage taken is manageable enough to keep progressing in the game. The
assets align well with the theme, featuring simple yet appealing
animations that make the game engaging. The main goal of the game could
be made clearer, as players may not realize they need to collect four
keys to open a chest and escape.</p>
<h4 id="optional-features-feedback">Optional features feedback</h4>
<hr />
<p>There are no optional features implemented in this game.</p>
<hr />
<p>The game lacks any optional features, like a hard mode, easy mode,
against the clock mode, etc. Aspects like that can provide with more
content for the player to enjoy, giving incentive to spend more time
with it.</p>
<hr />
<p>The game currently lacks optional features. Some potential additions
could include a timeout to complete the game, additional difficulty
modes requiring more keys to open the chest, and the inclusion of more
enemies or stronger ones.</p>

<p>Positives Clear and engaging pitch line that sets the game’s tone.
Well-structured feature list and formal description. Difficulty tiers

game balances challenge as the player advances. Add More Player
Motivation: Consider introducing additional incentives, like
achievements or unlockable content, to encourage replayability.</p>
<hr />
<p>Good</p>
<hr />
<p>Some points aren't described directly but are understood on other
sections of the document</p>
<h4 id="formal-game-description-feedback-1">Formal game description
feedback</h4>
<hr />
<p>Positives The document effectively links gameplay elements to
specific code functions. The progression system is well-structured and
logically implemented. The player actions are clearly defined and mapped
in the source code. Improvements Enhance Clarity: Expand explanations on
how each function contributes to gameplay flow. Refine Victory
Conditions: Consider adding more details on how success/failure impacts
future gameplay. Improve Readability: Add more structure to
descriptions, such as bullet points or step-by-step breakdowns.</p>
<hr />
<p>Yes</p>
<hr />
<p>Everything in the document is clear and can be found easily on the
source code</p>
<h4 id="implementation-feedback-1">Implementation Feedback</h4>
<hr />
<p>Positives Well-documented game state, setup, and player actions.
Clear implementation of progression and enemy AI behavior. Victory
conditions are properly defined and linked to game flow. Improvements
Enhance Code Comments: Add more inline comments in key functions for
easier readability. Optimize Player Movement: Improve control
responsiveness to refine the stealth experience. Expand Victory System:
Consider adding alternative success conditions, like bonus rewards for
undetected runs.</p>
<hr />
<p>Very good</p>
<hr />
<p>Implementation is clear and coincides with everything on the
document</p>
<h4 id="challenge-feedback-1">Challenge Feedback</h4>
<hr />
<p>I like the 3D design.</p>
<hr />
<p>The game dynamic is good because you have to be smart to continue to
be free of the guards who are looking for you.</p>
<hr />
<p>Game is a lot of fun and the theme of Freedom fits perfectly</p>
<h4 id="design-feedback-1">Design Feedback</h4>
<hr />
<p>Positives Well-structured stealth mechanics that encourage strategy.
Meaningful choices in movement, distraction, and enemy avoidance. Clear
objectives and difficulty levels to challenge players. Improvements
Refine Controls: Improve responsiveness for smoother player movement.
Enhance Player Feedback: Provide clearer UI cues for key actions like
hiding and unlocking doors. Increase Replayability: Introduce random
enemy patrols or alternate escape routes for variety.</p>
<hr />
<p>The controls are simple and you get a button prompt to pick up
objects, open chests and open doors. The choices of running and going
after the key or approaching the game with caution are meaningful
because if the guards detect you, you are most probably going to
die.Overall a fun experience</p>
<hr />
<p>Game is fun to play and can be a bit hard at times which can be
engaging fo players to try and beat those harder levels, whoever in the
earlier levels the guards can almost be ignored</p>
<h4 id="optional-features-feedback-1">Optional features feedback</h4>
<hr />
<p>Positives Difficulty levels (Gold, Silver, Bronze) provide a scalable
challenge. The time-based ranking system adds replayability. Map codes
make progression more flexible. Improvements More Customization: Allow
players to set difficulty modifiers, such as reduced enemy detection or
extra time. Bonus Challenges: Introduce optional stealth objectives
(e.g., complete without being spotted for extra rewards). Adaptive
Difficulty: Consider scaling difficulty based on player performance for
a more personalized experience.</p>
<hr />
<p>No hard mode, no easy mode, those are necessary. Optional features
are good like the AI of the guards and the pickable objects.</p>
<hr />
<p>Each level is timed and a scoreboard in the main menu displays the
best time which makes the game replayable to try and achieve the best
time possible and even competitive</p>

<h3 id="feedback-2">Feedback</h3>
<h4 id="concept-document-feedback-2">Concept document feedback</h4>
<hr />
<p>Still needs to be clarified</p>
<hr />
<p>Document is well structured and everything was easy to find and
understand</p>
<hr />
<p>The concept document only lack some information about the
skill/change balance and the strategic choices. Despite the strategic
choices being mentioned, the are not much information about them. You
also talk about the players improving their skill but you directly don't
mentioned the skill/change balance.</p>
<h4 id="formal-game-description-feedback-2">Formal game description
feedback</h4>
<hr />
<p>No direct references to the code are made</p>
<hr />
<p>Most of the points explained what happened and how it worked but
lacked the location in the source code although most of that was easy to
find</p>
<hr />
<p>Since the game state is inconclusive, i could not find an
implementation of it. You should have reference that in each moment the
game state has the players and enemies positions and the coins acquired
by the them. The progress of play was not implemented since you say that
the game has no level progression, but it exist a game progression in
each loop game that says if a player died or not and if someone has
reached the end game. The player's actions, victory conditions, game
setup and game views are presented in the code and in the formal game
description.</p>
<h4 id="implementation-feedback-2">Implementation Feedback</h4>
<hr />
<p>Only the game setup and the player actions are explicitly present in
the code.</p>
<hr />
<p>Most of the points were easy to find and lined up with the
documentation, the only point that wasn't well explained was the game
state although it wasn't very hard to find the implementation</p>
<hr />
<p>I found the information about these points in the documentation, and
since they don't have any mathematical expression they were also in the
code. The progress of play was not implemented since you say that the
game has no level progression, but it exist a game progression in each
loop game. The game state is not correctly documented, but the
information you have in it, is presented in the game.</p>
<h4 id="challenge-feedback-2">Challenge Feedback</h4>
<hr />
<p>The camera placement is bad and affects the progression of the
level</p>
<hr />
<p>I don't think the game fits well in the theme freedom as the player
is not running away or escaping from something, this is more of a race
game</p>
<hr />
<p>The game is very fun to play and the competitiveness keeps the
players engaged. There are no errors and the theme is within the
requirement(freedom).</p>
<h4 id="design-feedback-2">Design Feedback</h4>
<hr />
<p>So the game requires players to explore the level. The second camera
angle needs to be fixed</p>
<hr />
<p>While the controls for player 1 were easy to understand and there
were signs explaining them the controls for player 2 were nowhere to be
found. Despite the movement was easy to figure out, I had to randomly
press buttons to find which made the player 2 jump.</p>
<hr />
<p>The game is fun to play and the goal might appear not clear, but as
soon as we start playing we realize what we must do and what is the
objective. The competitiveness and the game mechanics and dynamics keep
the player motivated and engaged. We have the freedom to choose a path
and to try to beat the adversary. The assets match the theme and the
difficulty is adequate.</p>
<h4 id="optional-features-feedback-2">Optional features feedback</h4>
<hr />
<p>Adding these modes would be good.</p>
<hr />
<p>Featuring a split-screen multiplayer makes the game much more
enjoyable</p>
<hr />
<p>Despite the game not having a easy, hard or against the clock mode,
it possesses a optional feature. This feature allows the 2 player to
play against each other repetitively.</p>

<h4 id="concept-document-feedback-3">Concept document feedback</h4>
<hr />
<p>The concept document does not have any pitch line. There are a
conclusion, but not any introduction to the game.The demographic
breakdown lacks information like the intended platforms and the genre of
the game. I also could not found any formal description of the game in
the document. The concept document outlines all other necessary
points.</p>
<hr />
<p>The concept document lacks a pitch line, an introductory paragraph, a
bullet-list feature list with its breakdown, and a formal game
description. These are all crucial elements for understanding the game,
its mechanics, and how everything functions in the 'background.' Despite
these missing components, the document does include the player goals,
core mechanics and dynamics, elements of strategic choice, and the
skill/balance changes, which are essential for understanding the game's
design. Including the missing elements would provide a more complete
overview, making it easier for developers and players to grasp the full
scope of the game.</p>
<hr />
<p>Concept document explains all points of the game but some of them are
poorly explained, moslty just pointing what that section is about but
not explaining how it was implemented</p>
<h4 id="formal-game-description-feedback-3">Formal game description
feedback</h4>
<hr />
<p>I could not found the formal game description section, but indirectly
i could retrieve some informations like the player actions and the game
views. The victory conditions i could only found in the source code. The
rest of the required information i could not found.</p>
<hr />
<p>Since there is no formal game description, it doesn't describe nor
locate the things mentioned above. This absence makes it difficult to
understand how these elements fit together within the overall game
design and gameplay.</p>
<hr />
<p>Like mentioned previously the document explains briefly what was
implemented but not how it was implement nor where in the code. And some
points are even missing on the document</p>
<h4 id="implementation-feedback-3">Implementation Feedback</h4>
<hr />
<p>I couldn't find these sections specifically in the document, but for
some of them they were present. In the code and in the documentation i
couldn't find any information about the game state or the game setup. In
the documentation i could understand what are the game views and what
are the player actions. The progression of play i could not found in the
documentation and in the code, but the victory conditions i just found
in the code.</p>
<hr />
<p>It took me some time to find the implementation and documentation for
the game state, game setup, game views, player actions, victory
conditions, and the progress of play. Even after a while, I couldn't
find everything fully documented or completed. It would be helpful to
have clearer, more accessible documentation that outlines these
components in a more organized way. This could prevent delays and
confusion, especially for new developers or players trying to understand
the game's structure. Additionally, providing more detailed
documentation on areas like game views or victory conditions could
improve the overall development experience and make the game easier to
understand.</p>
<hr />
<p>After looking for some time I was able to found the implementation
but it is a bit confusing as there are some aspects that didn't seem to
make into the game but are still present in the code and also some
naming conventions aren't clear which made the implementation
confusing</p>
<h4 id="challenge-feedback-3">Challenge Feedback</h4>
<hr />
<p>The theme of the game is freedom and does not present any errors. The
dynamic is interesting and keeps the player engaged.</p>
<hr />
<p>The game’s dynamics are quite engaging, and the theme of freedom is
well represented. However, there are some bugs that need to be addressed
to enhance the overall experience.</p>
<hr />
<p>The game fits well the Freedom theme but seems to be lacking on the
level designs as there seems to be missing the challenge players need to
face to complete the game</p>
<h4 id="design-feedback-3">Design Feedback</h4>
<hr />
<p>While the game play offers a degree of fun, because the
straightforward win condition, requiring only forward movement without
enemy encounters, limits strategic depth and player engagement; the lack
of player aiming control reduces the sense of challenge. The assets
could be better, since in some cases they don't match, like the freedom
direction and the rest of the arena. Some musics/sounds could be added
to increase the player's excitement. The controls are easy to use, the
difficulty is adequate, there are meaningful choices and the goal is
clear.</p>
<hr />
<p>The game is partially fun to play, but as mentioned before, there are
some bugs that hinder the player’s experience, making it less enjoyable.
The mechanics and dynamics manage to keep the player engaged for a
while, and there are meaningful choices, such as selecting between easy
and hard modes, which do impact gameplay. The controls are easy to use,
the assets align well with the theme, and the difficulty level is
appropriate for the target audience.</p>
<hr />
<p>The game goal is clear and the player has some control on how the
game plays depending on the difficulty they choose but like was said on
the previous point, lacks the challenge as there are no enemies or they
are to far from the actual game scene to represent a challenge which
makes the game boring to play</p>
<h4 id="optional-features-feedback-3">Optional features feedback</h4>
<hr />
<p>The game presents a easy and a hard mode. For each mode some
attributes of the enemies are changed and the freedom exit is also
different.</p>
<hr />
<p>The game includes an easy and a hard mode, but beyond that, it lacks
an 'against the clock' mode or any other optional features that could
add variety and replayability. Introducing additional game modes or
optional challenges could significantly enhance the player experience by
offering more ways to engage with the game.</p>
<hr />
<p>The menu to choose game difficulty is in-game, meaning you move the
character to choose the difficulty which is a nice way to do it compared
to the classic menu</p>

<h3 id="feedback-4">Feedback</h3>
<h4 id="concept-document-feedback-4">Concept document feedback</h4>
<hr />
<p>Positives Clear game premise with a strong pitch line. Defined player
motivation with an engaging adventure theme. Simple and effective
mechanics suitable for the target audience. Improvements Expand feature
breakdown: Explain how each mechanic enhances gameplay. Clarify
strategic choices: Justify why players need to make meaningful
decisions. Improve skill progression: Detail how difficulty evolves over
time to keep players engaged.</p>
<hr />
<p>Elements still missing</p>
<hr />
<p>The concept document is well-structured, featuring a strong pitch
line and a clear, concise introductory paragraph. However, the feature
list could be more detailed by including the game modes. The
implementation reference is straightforward and covers all the main
points, but it could benefit from additional details about the classes
used.</p>
<h4 id="formal-game-description-feedback-4">Formal game description
feedback</h4>
<hr />
<p>Positives Clearly maps game elements to the code for easy reference.
Defines player actions and goals effectively. Basic mechanics are
well-explained and aligned with the code. Improvements Expand UI
details: Describe how player feedback (e.g., health, enemy count) is
presented. Improve progression explanation: Clarify how the game evolves
(e.g., increasing difficulty, new mechanics). Consider alternative
victory conditions: Add more depth beyond defeating all slimes.</p>
<hr />
<p>The concept document does not have direct references to the code</p>
<hr />
<p>The concept document provides information about the state, setup,
views, actions, victory, and progression, explaining the applied logic
for each point in a direct manner. The information is simple and easy to
understand but could include more detailed explanations about the
classes, methods used, and the overall logic flow. This additional
detail would be helpful, even though the logic is straightforward enough
to follow through the code.</p>
<h4 id="implementation-feedback-4">Implementation Feedback</h4>
<hr />
<p>Positives Core game logic is well-structured and clearly implemented.
Victory and defeat conditions are functional and properly linked to the
game loop. Player actions are straightforward and responsive.
Improvements Enhance UI feedback: Display health bars, remaining slimes,
or a progress tracker for better player awareness. Expand progression
mechanics: Introduce level-ups, enemy scaling, or unlockable abilities
to create a more engaging experience. Improve documentation clarity: Add
more comments in key functions for better readability and easier
debugging.</p>
<hr />
<p>Good enough</p>
<hr />
<p>The implementation is easy to follow because the logic is simple. The
code is reasonably organized, with a few small improvements to be made,
such as the difficulty selection methods that contain repetitive code.
One thing that needs to be changed is the fact that the player decides
the amount of damage taken, this could be parameterized within the enemy
class.</p>
<h4 id="challenge-feedback-4">Challenge Feedback</h4>
<hr />
<p>Positives Classic and accessible gameplay: The game’s simple
mechanics make it easy to pick up and play. Exploration element: A
variety of environments (forests, ruins) encourages movement and
discovery. Clear victory conditions: The objective of defeating all
slimes is straightforward. Improvements Enhance the sense of freedom:
Introduce multiple paths to victory, such as alternative goals (e.g.,
diplomacy, resource collection). Improve game dynamics: Add mechanics
like different enemy behaviors, boss fights, or item pickups to keep
combat engaging. Clarify game completeness: Ensure all mechanics
function properly and consider including a testing phase for balancing
difficulty.</p>
<hr />
<p>Very good game of freedom</p>
<hr />
<p>The game's objective is simple (eliminate all the slimes on the map).
There are minor bugs when the player attacks while moving, as well as
some graphical z-index issues. The map is quite large, but the game
screen only displays a small portion of it, which can make it easy for
the player to get lost. Overall, the game is not bad, but it could
benefit from additional features.</p>
<h4 id="design-feedback-4">Design Feedback</h4>
<hr />
<p>Positives Simple and accessible gameplay suitable for younger
audiences. Clear goals and structured combat make the game easy to
understand. Retro pixel-art assets complement the game’s theme.
Improvements Add gameplay variety: Introduce new enemy types, boss
fights, or special abilities to make combat more engaging. Increase
meaningful choices: Implement power-ups or defensive strategies to offer
different ways to play. Improve difficulty balance: Consider adaptive
difficulty based on player performance to enhance long-term
engagement.</p>
<hr />
<p>No errors here</p>
<hr />
<p>The assets align well with the game's theme and objective, creating
an enjoyable environment complemented by pleasant background music. The
difficulty is appropriately adjusted for the target demographic, but the
game feels too easy because health is restored very quickly. The
controls are intuitive, but the game lacks information on which keys
perform specific actions. While the goal is simple, there is no in-game
information about the objective, and in my opinion, it misses important
details, such as how many slimes are left to kill.</p>
<h4 id="optional-features-feedback-4">Optional features feedback</h4>
<hr />
<p>Positives Core mechanics work well, providing a foundation for
expansion. Straightforward combat and exploration make the game
accessible to younger players. Improvements Add difficulty modes:
Implement an easy and hard mode to cater to different player skill
levels. Introduce a time-based challenge: Consider an optional mode
where players must defeat slimes within a time limit. Expand optional
content: Include collectibles, power-ups, or achievements to enhance
replayability.</p>
<hr />
<p>Other optional features and against the clock mode missing</p>
<hr />
<p>There are some optional features in the game, such as three different
difficulty modes. The differences between the modes are based on the
amount of damage the player takes and deals. However, when playing the
game, the differences between the modes are not very noticeable.
Additional features that could be added include a timeout clock
requiring the player to kill all the enemies before time runs out, or a
timed mode where the player must kill a defined number of slimes. In
this mode, slimes could respawn in different locations after being
defeated.</p>

<h3 id="feedback-5">Feedback</h3>
<h4 id="concept-document-feedback-5">Concept document feedback</h4>
<hr />
<p>The concept document is well-structured in several key areas. It
includes a pitch line, an introductory paragraph, a demographic
breakdown, a bullet-list feature list, a feature-list breakdown, and a
formal game description, all of which are error-free. However, there are
significant gaps in crucial sections. The document does not describe the
goals that motivate the player, the core mechanics and dynamics, the
elements of strategic choice or the reasons for including them, nor the
skill/balance change. These missing components are critical, as they are
essential for understanding the depth of the gameplay and how the game
engages players. The absence of this information leaves important
aspects of the game unclear and makes it harder to fully grasp its
design and experience.</p>
<hr />
<p>The concept has all the required key points, with only one missing.
The description of the skill/change balance is not presented. I could
not found any information about the skill/change balance.</p>
<hr />
<p>Despite the implementation section was lacking, the rest of the
concept document was well done, but it did missed some aspects, like
describing the elements of strategic choice and the skill/change
balance. Outside of that, the rest of it meets the expectations of a
concept document.</p>
<h4 id="formal-game-description-feedback-5">Formal game description
feedback</h4>
<hr />
<p>The formal game description does a good job of describing and
locating the game setup, game views, player actions, and the progression
of play in the source code, with no errors. However, it does not
describe or locate the victory conditions in the source code, which is a
critical omission. Despite this, by playing the game and reviewing the
'Condições de Vitória' section in the feature breakdown, it is possible
to infer the victory conditions. This lack of direct description in the
formal game documentation makes it less accessible for developers or
team members who rely solely on the documentation to understand the full
scope of the game.</p>
<hr />
<p>I could not found any information about the game state in your game
or in your document and the progression of play is not very clear in the
documentation, although that information is visible in the code. All the
remaining sections are in the code and in the document.</p>
<hr />
<p>It's needs to be better explained, with a few lines of your code
inserted in your document.</p>
<h4 id="implementation-feedback-5">Implementation Feedback</h4>
<hr />
<p>After looking at the code, I quickly discovered the player actions
and the victory conditions, both of which were well-documented with no
errors. However, when I searched for the implementation and
documentation for the game state, game setup, game views, and progress
of play, I found that some parts were missing or incomplete. There were
some errors in the available documentation, but none of them were
critical. Due to this incomplete information, I couldn’t fully locate or
understand these components, which made it harder to get a complete view
of the game's structure. Despite this, the well-documented player
actions and victory conditions made it easier to grasp the core aspects
of the gameplay.</p>
<hr />
<p>I could not found any information about the game state in your game
or in your document and the progression of play is not very clear in the
documentation. The victory conditions, player actions, game views and
game setup are clear in the documentation and in the code.</p>
<hr />
<p>The implementation section of the concept document feels extremely
lacking. It doesn't follow the example given by the teacher during
classes, but it doesn't exactly give enough information regarding each
subsection. It needs to be better explained and rely less on using text
and more on the use of pseudo code to relay each point.</p>
<h4 id="challenge-feedback-5">Challenge Feedback</h4>
<hr />
<p>This game is very good. The dynamics are engaging, and its theme
revolves around freedom. There are no major bugs, which makes it beta
quality.</p>
<hr />
<p>This engaging game explores the theme of freedom and features
strategic gameplay that captivates players.</p>
<hr />
<p>The game fails to follow with the theme of "freedom". As in, it fails
to provide player with freedom in how they approach the challenge the
game offers. While it is of beta quality, it needed more paths for the
player to take besides just one specific.</p>
<h4 id="design-feedback-5">Design Feedback</h4>
<hr />
<p>As said before, this game is very good. The game is fun to play, with
no errors encountered during testing. The player’s goals are clear and
well-defined, ensuring that players know exactly what they need to
accomplish. The mechanics and dynamics keep the player motivated and
engaged throughout the gameplay, with smooth and intuitive controls that
make the game easy to pick up. There are meaningful choices that add
depth to the experience, allowing players to feel in control of their
decisions. The assets, including characters, animations, and other
visual elements, match the game’s theme perfectly, enhancing the overall
experience. Finally, the game’s difficulty is appropriately tailored to
the target demographic, offering a challenge that is neither too easy
nor too difficult.</p>
<hr />
<p>The game is fun to play and the goal is clear. The strategy keeps the
player engaged and motivated and allow them to make meaningful choices.
The controls are also easy to discover and to use. The difficulty is
adequate but the game could have some sounds and music to keep the
player more excited. The animation of the player is not visible if we
make short distances like one click in each direction at a time.</p>
<hr />
<p>Even though the game doesn't offer much when it comes to being a fun
experience, it's overall design matches the theme. It has easy controls,
the assets match the them and the difficulty is adequate for the target
audience the author wanted the game to be for. The goals are clear but,
as I said before, it needs to offer meaningful choices, otherwise the
game will feel the same each time the player replays the game.</p>
<h4 id="optional-features-feedback-5">Optional features feedback</h4>
<hr />
<p>The game doesn't feature an easy or hard mode, only a normal mode. It
does offer a timed mode, but it's not an 'against the clock' mode.
Instead, it's a different mode that tracks the time the player takes to
finish the game, providing a way to challenge completion speed but not
in the traditional sense of racing against a timer during gameplay</p>
<hr />
<p>The game does not have a against the clock, hard or easy mode, but
possesses a time mode, where the player can try to beat his time. The
best time is not being saved, preventing the player to check what score
to beat. There is a normal mode where the player can practice and play
the game for fun.</p>
<hr />
<p>The game doesn't offer no easy or hard mode, but offers an against
the clock mode, which allows to compete with friends on who finishes the
game in less time. I didn't find any other optional features that might
be relevant to mention. Having an easy and hard mode can provide with
more content for the experience. With this game, he could make the hard
mode by having the map more complicated to go through.</p>

<h3 id="feedback-6">Feedback</h3>
<h4 id="concept-document-feedback-6">Concept document feedback</h4>
<hr />
<p>Positives Well-structured and detailed breakdown of game mechanics
and features. Clear and engaging player motivation centered around
survival and progression. Defined target audience and platform support
help position the game effectively. Improvements Expand on strategic
choices: Explain how different player actions affect long-term survival.
Clarify skill progression: Describe how enemies or challenges scale to
match player experience. Include more variation in difficulty: Suggest
optional gameplay paths or adaptive mechanics to keep engagement
high.</p>
<hr />
<p>The concept document is well done, can explain well what the game is
about, but it does lack a clear goal for the player to engage with the
game.</p>
<hr />
<p>The Concept Document is complete, providing a thorough explanation of
the game structure and the logic behind key decisions. The feature list
is also complete, but some features do not work as intended during
gameplay due to issues in the implementation. While the explanation of
the logic used in the implementation is accurate, it could benefit from
additional detail.</p>
<h4 id="formal-game-description-feedback-6">Formal game description
feedback</h4>
<hr />
<p>Positives Clear mapping of gameplay elements to source code
functions. Well-structured progression system that dynamically increases
difficulty. Detailed documentation on player actions and combat
mechanics. Improvements Expand explanations on enemy scaling: Provide
more details on how enemy strength evolves over time. Enhance UI
clarity: Describe additional feedback elements for the player (e.g.,
damage indicators, wave progression). Consider alternative victory
conditions: Introduce optional goals beyond survival, such as milestones
or achievements.</p>
<hr />
<p>Each element of the implementation are presented well, so there's no
need to be critical about it.</p>
<hr />
<p>The formal description identifies and locates all the main points in
the code, presenting code snippets that correspond to the actual
implementation. It includes brief and direct explanations of what each
method or class does but could provide more detail about the overall
logic flow.</p>
<h4 id="implementation-feedback-6">Implementation Feedback</h4>
<hr />
<p>Positives Well-documented code with clear references to player state
and enemy behaviors. Smooth progression system that increases difficulty
dynamically. Effective HUD implementation for real-time player feedback.
Improvements Enhance game state tracking: Add more feedback elements
like a progress meter for wave completion. Improve variety in
progression: Introduce new challenges, such as boss fights or changing
environments. Expand victory conditions: Consider alternative win
scenarios beyond simple survival (e.g., reaching a level milestone).</p>
<hr />
<p>The Concept Document contains the implementation section. While it
isn't how it's usually done (according to how the teacher has done), it
manages to explain how each aspect of it works. But, it's important to
do it in a way that makes it easier for others to read, especially to
people who have no coding knowledge.</p>
<hr />
<p>The overall implementation is fine, with all the main points
addressed and logic that is easy to follow, supported by well-named
methods. However, there are some issues in the code, such as unused
multiplayer functionality, a non-dynamic player level update that does
not affect gameplay, and the lack of enemy respawn even when all of them
are dead. Additionally, there is a problem with the game screen size
when restarting the game. These issues indicate that the game is not yet
fully complete</p>
<h4 id="challenge-feedback-6">Challenge Feedback</h4>
<hr />
<p>Improvements Expand player choices: Add alternative progression paths
or strategies beyond pure combat. Enhance the freedom theme: Introduce
more exploration elements or branching paths. Improve enemy variety:
Different attack patterns or behaviors could keep the combat fresh.</p>
<hr />
<p>While the game follows the theme of "Freedom" he failed to provide a
full game to take advantage of it. Even though the mechanics of it are
there and there's a good concept out of it, it still failed to provide a
fullfiling experience for the player. The best to do is to have a clear
objective for the game, while still following the theme.</p>
<hr />
<p>The objective of the game is unclear. After defeating the enemies,
there is nothing left to do. Additionally, the menu displays a label for
selecting the number of players, even though the game is single-player.
The assets are fine, and the controls are reasonable. However, one issue
that affects the game's quality is that if the player dies and restarts
the game, the game screen becomes very small.</p>
<h4 id="design-feedback-6">Design Feedback</h4>
<hr />
<p>Positives Fast-paced and engaging combat mechanics. Well-structured
difficulty scaling that maintains challenge. Pixel-art assets align well
with the game’s theme. Improvements Introduce more meaningful choices:
Add power-ups, different abilities, or alternate strategies beyond
combat. Enhance enemy variety: Different attack patterns or behaviors
could make battles more dynamic. Expand level diversity: Introduce
environmental interactions or unique hazards to keep gameplay fresh.</p>
<hr />
<p>The only positive aspect of the game design is that the controls are
easy and that the assets match the theme of "freedom". Aside from that,
the game is lacking. There's no goals, no meaningful choices and no
motivation. You might say that it lacks the "fun factor". To solve that,
the game needs a clear goal for the player to engage with the game,
something that "motivates" him/her into go through the game until the
end.</p>
<hr />
<p>This is an arcade game where the objective is to survive and kill
enemies. However, the game does not function as intended because the
number of enemies in the scene does not regenerate. As a result, the
game lacks the ability to motivate and engage the player to continue
playing. The difficulty is fine and appropriately balanced, and the
assets match the theme well. The game is not enjoyable due to its
shortcomings</p>
<h4 id="optional-features-feedback-6">Optional features feedback</h4>
<hr />
<p>Positives The progressive difficulty system naturally increases the
challenge over time. The leveling mechanic encourages long-term
engagement. Improvements Add difficulty modes: Allow players to choose
easy, normal, or hard for a tailored experience. Include a time-based
challenge mode: Introduce an optional mode where players must defeat
enemies within a set time limit. Expand optional content: Implement
unlockable skills, special challenges, or bonus objectives for
replayability.</p>
<hr />
<p>The game lacks any of the optional features, like hard mode, easy
mode, against the clock, etc. There isn't much to say about it besides
that having any of those optional features can increase the challenge of
the game, which provides with more content for the player to enjoy.</p>
<hr />
<p>There are no optional features in the game. Some additional features
that could be added, considering it is an arcade game: include a timed
mode where the player must kill a certain number of enemies within a set
time limit. This could be further enhanced by introducing different
difficulty modes that define the number of enemies and the time
limit.</p>
