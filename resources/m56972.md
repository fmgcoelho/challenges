### Feedback

#### Design Feedback


The only thing this game lacks are meaningful choices. However, it is fun to play, its goals are clear, and controlling the character is easy. The difficulty is well-suited to the target audience, and the assets align perfectly with the theme.

----


The game provides with a fun gameplay loop, which is a positive thing about it. While the controls are easy to use, the game&amp;#039;s assets aren&amp;#039;t all that well presented. It felt like it rushed the design and forgot about some parts, like the shadows are &amp;quot;clipping&amp;quot; through the floor, or the corners of the grass area don&amp;#039;t exist. The game does provides a goal, yet the game doesn&amp;#039;t show it. In fact, at the beginning of the game, the text tells the object, but was extremely small and pixelated that no player wouldn&amp;#039;t see it clearly.

----


The game is fun, but the player’s movement could be less restricted by allowing diagonal controls. The difficulty is well-balanced featuring two main enemies that approach the player when close. The amount of damage taken is manageable enough to keep progressing in the game. The assets align well with the theme, featuring simple yet appealing animations that make the game engaging. The main goal of the game could be made clearer, as players may not realize they need to collect four keys to open a chest and escape.

----

#### Formal Feedback


The formal game description in the document effectively covers the state, setup, views, player actions, victory conditions, and progression of play. However, it could be improved by specifying where these elements are located in the source code, making it easier for developers to navigate and understand the implementation.

----


The formal game description does provide with the code content for each aspect of the implementation.

----


The formal game description could provide more detail about the classes and methods used in the game. However, it effectively describes all the key points and aligns well with the applied logic, making it easy to locate the corresponding implementation in the code.

----

#### Challenge Feedback


The game is very good. Its dynamics are engaging, and no major bugs were found, making it beta quality. Additionally, the theme of this game is Freedom.

----


The game follows the theme of &amp;quot;freedom&amp;quot;. While the game feels simplistic in nature, it provides a good challenge, while maintaining the theme and have a goal for the player. There isn&amp;#039;t much to criticize in this section.

----


The game is simple and engaging with a clear objective. The player must find all four keys to unlock a chest and win the game. The keys are placed in different positions on the map, which is large enough that the player may sometimes feel lost. There are many enemies and health packs that help the player on their journey. I think the game could benefit from more maps with increasing difficulty. The controls are simple but lack the option for diagonal movement. Overall, it’s a good game.

----

#### Implementation Feedback


Everything was found within the code, including the implementation and documentation of the game state, game setup, game views, player actions, victory conditions, and progress of play.

----


The implementation section of the concept document isn&amp;#039;t done similar to how the teach has taught us. But, it manages to provide with information regarding each aspect of it well. But, I do believe it&amp;#039;s best to follow with the format proposed by the teacher, which makes it less time consuming during the reading of the concept document.

----


The documentation provides a good summary of the main implementation points. However, the code logic for applying damage to the player or enemy could be improved. Instead of using fixed values, the player and enemy could have a parameter called &amp;quot;attack&amp;quot; that determines the damage they deal, rather than having the damage defined hard coded. The same approach could be applied to medical packs, allowing them to restore health based on a &amp;quot;healing&amp;quot; parameter. Additionally, the game view could be enhanced by including more details such as the number of keys the player has found.

----

#### Optional Feedback


There are no optional features implemented in this game.

----


The game lacks any optional features, like a hard mode, easy mode, against the clock mode, etc. Aspects like that can provide with more content for the player to enjoy, giving incentive to spend more time with it.

----


The game currently lacks optional features. Some potential additions could include a timeout to complete the game, additional difficulty modes requiring more keys to open the chest, and the inclusion of more enemies or stronger ones.

----

#### Conceptdoc Feedback


The concept document is well-structured and includes most key elements. However, it could be improved by adding the goals that motivate the player, the core mechanics and dynamics, the elements of strategic choice along with their justification, and the skill/challenge balance. Including these aspects would provide a more complete and refined game design.

----


The concept document is extremely well done, yet it&amp;#039;s missing aspect of it, like describing elements of strategic choice and skill/change balance.

----


The concept document is well-conceived, covering all the main points. However, the Implementation Reference could be more specific about the methods or classes used. The bullet points and feature list are well-detailed, covering all aspects the player will encounter while playing the game. The pitch line is enthusiastic, and the introduction provides a clear and concise summary of the game&amp;#039;s objective.
