### Feedback

#### Design Feedback


As said before, this game is very good. The game is fun to play, with no errors encountered during testing. The player’s goals are clear and well-defined, ensuring that players know exactly what they need to accomplish. The mechanics and dynamics keep the player motivated and engaged throughout the gameplay, with smooth and intuitive controls that make the game easy to pick up. There are meaningful choices that add depth to the experience, allowing players to feel in control of their decisions. The assets, including characters, animations, and other visual elements, match the game’s theme perfectly, enhancing the overall experience. Finally, the game’s difficulty is appropriately tailored to the target demographic, offering a challenge that is neither too easy nor too difficult.

----


The game is fun to play and the goal is clear. The strategy keeps the player engaged and motivated and allow them to make meaningful choices. The controls are also easy to discover and to use. The difficulty is adequate but the game could have some sounds and music to keep the player more excited. The animation of the player is not visible if we make short distances like one click in each direction at a time.

----


Even though the game doesn&amp;#039;t offer much when it comes to being a fun experience, it&amp;#039;s overall design matches the theme. It has easy controls, the assets match the them and the difficulty is adequate for the target audience the author wanted the game to be for. The goals are clear but, as I said before, it needs to offer meaningful choices, otherwise the game will feel the same each time the player replays the game.

----

#### Formal Feedback


The formal game description does a good job of describing and locating the game setup, game views, player actions, and the progression of play in the source code, with no errors. However, it does not describe or locate the victory conditions in the source code, which is a critical omission. Despite this, by playing the game and reviewing the &amp;#039;Condições de Vitória&amp;#039; section in the feature breakdown, it is possible to infer the victory conditions. This lack of direct description in the formal game documentation makes it less accessible for developers or team members who rely solely on the documentation to understand the full scope of the game.

----


I could not found any information about the game state in your game or in your document and the progression of play is not very clear in the documentation, although that information is visible in the code. All the remaining sections are in the code and in the document.

----


It&amp;#039;s needs to be better explained, with a few lines of your code inserted in your document.

----

#### Challenge Feedback


This game is very good. The dynamics are engaging, and its theme revolves around freedom. There are no major bugs, which makes it beta quality.

----


This engaging game explores the theme of freedom and features strategic gameplay that captivates players.

----


The game fails to follow with the theme of &amp;quot;freedom&amp;quot;. As in, it fails to provide player with freedom in how they approach the challenge the game offers. While it is of beta quality, it needed more paths for the player to take besides just one specific.

----

#### Implementation Feedback


After looking at the code, I quickly discovered the player actions and the victory conditions, both of which were well-documented with no errors. However, when I searched for the implementation and documentation for the game state, game setup, game views, and progress of play, I found that some parts were missing or incomplete. There were some errors in the available documentation, but none of them were critical. Due to this incomplete information, I couldn’t fully locate or understand these components, which made it harder to get a complete view of the game&amp;#039;s structure. Despite this, the well-documented player actions and victory conditions made it easier to grasp the core aspects of the gameplay.

----


I could not found any information about the game state in your game or in your document and the progression of play is not very clear in the documentation. The victory conditions, player actions, game views and game setup are clear in the documentation and in the code.

----


The implementation section of the concept document feels extremely lacking. It doesn&amp;#039;t follow the example given by the teacher during classes, but it doesn&amp;#039;t exactly give enough information regarding each subsection. It needs to be better explained and rely less on using text and more on the use of pseudo code to relay each point.

----

#### Optional Feedback


The game doesn&amp;#039;t feature an easy or hard mode, only a normal mode. It does offer a timed mode, but it&amp;#039;s not an &amp;#039;against the clock&amp;#039; mode. Instead, it&amp;#039;s a different mode that tracks the time the player takes to finish the game, providing a way to challenge completion speed but not in the traditional sense of racing against a timer during gameplay

----


The game does not have a against the clock, hard or easy mode, but possesses a time mode, where the player can try to beat his time. The best time is not being saved, preventing the player to check what score to beat. There is a normal mode where the player can practice and play the game for fun.

----


The game doesn&amp;#039;t offer no easy or hard mode, but offers an against the clock mode, which allows to compete with friends on who finishes the game in less time. I didn&amp;#039;t find any other optional features that might be relevant to mention. Having an easy and hard mode can provide with more content for the experience. With this game, he could make the hard mode by having the map more complicated to go through.

----

#### Conceptdoc Feedback


The concept document is well-structured in several key areas. It includes a pitch line, an introductory paragraph, a demographic breakdown, a bullet-list feature list, a feature-list breakdown, and a formal game description, all of which are error-free. However, there are significant gaps in crucial sections. The document does not describe the goals that motivate the player, the core mechanics and dynamics, the elements of strategic choice or the reasons for including them, nor the skill/balance change. These missing components are critical, as they are essential for understanding the depth of the gameplay and how the game engages players. The absence of this information leaves important aspects of the game unclear and makes it harder to fully grasp its design and experience.

----


The concept has all the required key points, with only one missing. The description of the skill/change balance is not presented. I could not found any information about the skill/change balance.

----


Despite the implementation section was lacking, the rest of the concept document was well done, but it did missed some aspects, like describing the elements of strategic choice and the skill/change balance. Outside of that, the rest of it meets the expectations of a concept document.
