### Feedback

#### Design Feedback


While the game play offers a degree of fun, because the straightforward win condition, requiring only forward movement without enemy encounters, limits strategic depth and player engagement; the lack of player aiming control reduces the sense of challenge. The assets could be better, since in some cases they don&amp;#039;t match, like the freedom direction and the rest of the arena. Some musics/sounds could be added to increase the player&amp;#039;s excitement. The controls are easy to use, the difficulty is adequate, there are meaningful choices and the goal is clear.

----


The game is partially fun to play, but as mentioned before, there are some bugs that hinder the player’s experience, making it less enjoyable. The mechanics and dynamics manage to keep the player engaged for a while, and there are meaningful choices, such as selecting between easy and hard modes, which do impact gameplay. The controls are easy to use, the assets align well with the theme, and the difficulty level is appropriate for the target audience.

----


The game goal is clear and the player has some control on how the game plays depending on the difficulty they choose but like was said on the previous point, lacks the challenge as there are no enemies or they are to far from the actual game scene to represent a challenge which makes the game boring to play

----

#### Formal Feedback


I could not found the formal game description section, but indirectly i could retrieve some informations like the player actions and the game views. The victory conditions i could only found in the source code. The rest of the required information i could not found.

----


Since there is no formal game description, it doesn&amp;#039;t describe nor locate the things mentioned above. This absence makes it difficult to understand how these elements fit together within the overall game design and gameplay.

----


Like mentioned previously the document explains briefly what was implemented but not how it was implement nor where in the code. And some points are even missing on the document

----

#### Challenge Feedback


The theme of the game is freedom and does not present any errors. The dynamic is interesting and keeps the player engaged.

----


The game’s dynamics are quite engaging, and the theme of freedom is well represented. However, there are some bugs that need to be addressed to enhance the overall experience.

----


The game fits well the Freedom theme but seems to be lacking on the level designs as there seems to be missing the challenge players need to face to complete the game

----

#### Implementation Feedback


I couldn&amp;#039;t find these sections specifically in the document, but for some of them they were present. In  the code and in the documentation i couldn&amp;#039;t find any information about the game state or the game setup. In the documentation i could understand what are the game views and what are the player actions. The progression of play i could not found in the documentation and in the code, but the victory conditions i just found in the code.

----


It took me some time to find the implementation and documentation for the game state, game setup, game views, player actions, victory conditions, and the progress of play. Even after a while, I couldn&amp;#039;t find everything fully documented or completed. It would be helpful to have clearer, more accessible documentation that outlines these components in a more organized way. This could prevent delays and confusion, especially for new developers or players trying to understand the game&amp;#039;s structure. Additionally, providing more detailed documentation on areas like game views or victory conditions could improve the overall development experience and make the game easier to understand.

----


After looking for some time I was able to found the implementation but it is a bit confusing as there are some aspects that didn&amp;#039;t seem to make into the game but are still present in the code and also some naming conventions aren&amp;#039;t clear which made the implementation confusing

----

#### Optional Feedback


The game presents a easy and a hard mode. For each mode some attributes of the enemies are changed and the freedom exit is also different.

----


The game includes an easy and a hard mode, but beyond that, it lacks an &amp;#039;against the clock&amp;#039; mode or any other optional features that could add variety and replayability. Introducing additional game modes or optional challenges could significantly enhance the player experience by offering more ways to engage with the game.

----


The menu to choose game difficulty is in-game, meaning you move the character to choose the difficulty which is a nice way to do it compared to the classic menu

----

#### Conceptdoc Feedback


The concept document does not have any pitch line. There are a conclusion, but not any introduction to the game.The demographic breakdown lacks information like the intended platforms and the genre of the game. I also could not found any formal description of the game in the document. The concept document outlines all other necessary points.

----


The concept document lacks a pitch line, an introductory paragraph, a bullet-list feature list with its breakdown, and a formal game description. These are all crucial elements for understanding the game, its mechanics, and how everything functions in the &amp;#039;background.&amp;#039; Despite these missing components, the document does include the player goals, core mechanics and dynamics, elements of strategic choice, and the skill/balance changes, which are essential for understanding the game&amp;#039;s design. Including the missing elements would provide a more complete overview, making it easier for developers and players to grasp the full scope of the game.

----


Concept document explains all points of the game but some of them are poorly explained, moslty just pointing what that section is about but not explaining how it was implemented

----
